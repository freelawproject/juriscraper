(Carlisle), the general contractor for the construction project on which Drago had performed carpentry work, alleging that Drago had performed work for which it had not been paid.&nbsp; In its answer to Drago’s complaint, IFIC admitted that it was the surety on a labor and material payment bond that had been issued for the project.&nbsp; The proceedings then were stayed, and the parties submitted their dispute to arbitration in accordance with the Public Works Arbitration Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 16 of title 37.&nbsp; The arbitrator first found that no evidence had been presented that a bond existed for the project, and he accordingly found IFIC not liable to Drago.&nbsp; Because Drago was unaware that IFIC was contesting the existence of the bond, it sought to reopen the proceedings so that the bond could be introduced. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>The arbitrator issued two amended awards; in each, the arbitrator still found IFIC not liable to Drago, but he added that the award was “without prejudice to any rights of Drago as asserted in any pending litigation involving Drago and IFIC.”&nbsp; Additionally, the arbitrator found in the first amended award that IFIC’s liability was neither asserted nor denied at the arbitration proceedings, but he deleted this finding in the second amended award.&nbsp; Drago then filed a motion to confirm the second amended award with respect to Carlisle and to modify it with respect to IFIC so that, if Carlisle could not satisfy the award, IFIC would be liable.&nbsp; The Superior Court trial justice determined that the arbitrator’s findings with respect to whether the existence of the bond was at issue during the arbitration proceedings were unclear, especially when IFIC had conceded in its answer that it was the surety on the bond.&nbsp; The trial justice exercised what she believed to be her inherent authority to remand the case to the arbitrator for clarification of that issue.&nbsp; Upon remand, the arbitrator issued an award that found IFIC and Carlisle liable to Drago.&nbsp; When the trial justice confirmed the award after remand, IFIC appealed, contending that the Superior Court was without authority to remand the case back to the arbitrator for clarification. <br> <br>The Supreme Court held that the trial justice did not possess the inherent authority to remand the case back to the arbitrator for clarification.&nbsp; However, the Court determined that, because the phrase “without prejudice to any rights of Drago as asserted in any pending litigation involving Drago and IFIC” deprived the second amended award of the requisite finality and definiteness, the trial justice could have vacated the second amended award and remanded the case to the arbitrator for a rehearing under §§ 37-16-18 and 37-16-19.&nbsp; Because the trial justice’s actions accomplished the same result that would have been accomplished under §§ 37-16-18 and 37-16-19, the Court affirmed the judgment on other grounds. <br>&nbsp; <br></div></td></tr><tr><td class="ms-vb-tall" colspan="1"><a onfocus="OnLink(this)" href="/Courts/SupremeCourt/Opinions/11-280.pdf" onmousedown="return VerifyHref(this,event,'1','','')" onclick="return DispEx(this,event,'TRUE','FALSE','FALSE','','1','','','','','-1','1','0','0x3000031041')"></a></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><img src="/_layouts/images/blank.gif" width="100%" height="4" alt=""></td></tr><tr class="ms-alternating ms-newsletteralt"><td class="ms-vb2"><a target="_blank" href="10-255.pdf"><span class="style1">State v.

On appeal, Mr. Pichardo contended that inconsistencies in the evidence presented to the motion justice created genuine issues of material fact as to whether or not Ms. Stevens gave an unidentified driver consent to use her car on the date of a collision between Ms. Stevens’s car and Mr. Pichardo’s car. <br> <br>After a thorough review of the evidence, the Supreme Court held that there existed genuine issues of material fact in this case and that summary judgment should not have been granted. Mr. Pichardo’s complaint cited G.L. 1956 § 31-33-6, which provides that a vehicle owner may be liable for the acts of another person who operates the owner’s car “with the consent of the owner.” It was uncontested that Ms. Stevens was the registered owner of the vehicle involved in the collision. General Laws 1956 § 31-33-7 makes evidence of ownership “prima facie evidence that [the owner’s car] was being operated with the consent of the [owner].” Ms. Stevens presented an affidavit stating that she had not given the driver her consent and that her car was a stolen vehicle at the time of the collision. However, at the summary judgment stage, Ms. Stevens’s affidavit was insufficient to overcome the prima facie <br>evidence created by the General Assembly. Further, although Ms. Stevens had filed a stolen vehicle report with the police, there were inconsistencies between that report and other evidence in the record, including Ms. Stevens’s deposition testimony. These inconsistencies were related to the issue of consent; therefore, the Court held that a fact-finder was necessary to assess the credibility of witnesses and weigh the evidence. <br> <br>Accordingly, the Supreme Court reversed the grant of summary judgment.</div></td></tr><tr class="ms-alternating ms-newsletteralt"><td class="ms-vb-tall" colspan="1"><a onfocus="OnLink(this)" href="/Courts/SupremeCourt/Opinions/11-243.pdf" onmousedown="return VerifyHref(this,event,'1','','')" onclick="return DispEx(this,event,'TRUE','FALSE','FALSE','','1','','','','','-1','1','0','0x3000031041')"></a></td></tr><tr class="ms-alternating ms-newsletteralt"><td colspan="1"><img src="/_layouts/images/blank.gif" width="100%" height="4" alt=""></td></tr><tr><td class="ms-vb2"><a target="_blank" href="09-147.pdf"><span class="style1">Hector Jaiman v.
