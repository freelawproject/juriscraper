Current Situation:
 - Colorado has a PDF on their site with links to the other cases. No meta data is provided in a computer-readable
   format.
 - The bar association has content going back to 1996. According to the Clerk of the court, they get this from the
   court website and put it up manually.
 - West, Lexis, and CaseMaker all do the work manually, and charge for the results (Lexis charges up to $7.00 per
   query).
 - The Bar Association posts the Opinions but in a nearly unusable format.

Possible Solutions:
 - Volunteer submits the meta data for the court once/week.
 - Pay somebody to pull the information weekly.
 - Apply pressure on the court to do better.

Contact log:
 - 2013-06-05: Spoke to Chris Ryan, the clerk of the court. He's unable and unwilling to consider posting the
               content in a useful manner.
 - 2013-06-05: Left a message for Heather Clark at the Bar Association.
