<p><a name="1030592_20040305"></a><a href="opinions/opnscvwp/1030592.pdf"> 030592</a> <b>King George County Service Authority v. Presidential Service Company</b>  03/05/2004
The circuit court was correct in specifically enforcing an agreement for the purchase of a private water company's existing  water system by a county service authority under an agreement ratified by the authority's board, but erred in directing the authority to purchase other water and sewer system facilities because there was no resolution of the authority's board authorizing or ratifying a further agreement. The decree is affirmed in part and reversed in part.

<p><a name="1030634_20040305"></a><a href="opinions/opnscvwp/1030634.pdf"> 030634</a> <b>Harrison-Wyatt LLC v. Ratliff                     </b>  03/05/2004
The trial court correctly ruled that where a surface owner of a tract of land, or his predecessor-in-title, has conveyed all the  coal in and under his land, title to the coal bed methane gas in  the tract has not passed to the coal owner along with the coal. The trial court's judgment is affirmed. (Revised 4/1/04)

<p><a name="1030637_20040305"></a><a href="opinions/opnscvwp/1030637.pdf"> 030637</a> <b>Washington v. United Parcel Service               </b>  03/05/2004
In a workers' compensation appeal, the Court of Appeals erred in  addressing an issue of causal connection that was not properly before that court and not properly before the Commission. As a result, there was no basis for concluding that the claimant would be unjustly enriched by receiving benefits to which he was not entitled. A prior award of benefits remains valid, and the refusal to assess a 20% penalty was error. The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings. (Revised 3/8/04)

<p><a name="1942223_19950609"></a><a href="opinions/opnscvwp/1942223.pdf"> 942223</a> <b>Royal v. Commonwealth                             </b>  06/09/1995
The defendant was indicted for the capital murder of a police officer and use of a firearm in the commission of murder. He entered pleas of guilty on both charges and received sentences of death for the capital murder charge and three years imprisonment  for the firearms charge. The defendant's appeal of the imposition of the death penalty is considered along with the automatic review of the death sentence to which he is entitled under Code &#167 17.110.1. No reversible error is found among the issues presented; the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.
