This is one of the most ridiculous scrapers of them all. The list of unusual hacks includes:

1. We use the _download() method to log into the website and collect cookies that we later use for all requests.
2. The page with the content we want contains a beautiful table, but that table is generated using JavaScript from
   values that are in the JavaScript itself. We work around this in the _clean_text() method by parsing out the
   JavaScript lines and making them into a nice XML tree.
3. The root page contains Lists of Decisions in addition to actual opinions. They're easy to find, but the casing of the
   text is inconsistent (sometimes upper, sometimes lower, etc.) so we lowercase the case names (this doesn't affect the
   final results because we eventually get results from the linked pages).
4. Unfortunately, the values on the root page are incomplete, and the next page is also formed by executing JavaScript.
   We work around this by actually executing the JavaScript inside PhantomJS, then grabbing the content we want.
5. Once we have that content, we have to clean it up because it has more information than we need. We do this with a few
   string manipulation hacks in the inner function named fetcher().

What a fragile mess.
