                                                        Docket No. 5706–12.                            Filed May 6, 2013.

                                                  P was divorced from his wife, and their 2003 ‘‘Judgment of

                                               judgment provided that the dependency exemption deductions
                                               for the three children would be divided between the two ex-

                                               that the ex-wife must execute in P’s favor a Form 8332,

                                               than half of 2009, and P’s ex-wife did not execute in P’s favor

                                               claimed two dependency exemption deductions, so that one
                                               child was claimed on both parents’ returns. R allowed to P the
                                               dependency exemption deduction for one of the children but
                                               disallowed his claim for the dependency exemption deduction
                                               for the child who had also been claimed by the custodial
                                               parent. At trial P contended he is entitled to a dependency
                                               exemption deduction for all three children. Held: Since the
                                               custodial parent did not execute, and P could not and did not
                                               attach to his return, any Form 8332 or equivalent release, P
                                               is not entitled under I.R.C. sec. 152(e)(2)(A) to claim the
                                               dependency exemption deduction or the child tax credit. Held,
                                               further, where both the custodial parent and the noncustodial
                                               parent have claimed for the same year a dependency exemp-
                                               tion deduction for the same child, a declaration signed by the
                                               custodial parent after the period of limitations for assess-
                                               ments has expired as to the custodial parent could not qualify

                                               to grant P’s request to leave the record open so that he may
                                               obtain and proffer such a declaration. Held, further, P is not
                                               entitled to head-of-household filing status under I.R.C. sec.
                                               2(b)(1) nor to the child tax credit under I.R.C. sec. 24.

                                         GUSTAFSON, Judge: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
                                      determined a deficiency of $3,136 in the 2009 Federal income
                                      tax of petitioner Michael Keith Shenk. Mr. Shenk petitioned
                                      this Court, pursuant to section 6213(a), 1 for redetermination
                                      of the deficiency. After Mr. Shenk’s concession that he
                                      received but did not report $254 in dividend income, the
                                      issue for decision is whether Mr. Shenk is entitled to a
                                      dependency exemption deduction for one of his children
                                      under section 151(c), a child tax credit for that child under
                                      section 24(a), and head-of-household filing status under sec-
                                      tion 2(b)(1). On these issues, we hold for the IRS.

                                               dependency exemption deduction for one of the children but
                                               disallowed his claim for the dependency exemption deduction
                                               for the child who had also been claimed by the custodial
                                               parent. At trial P contended he is entitled to a dependency
                                               exemption deduction for all three children. Held: Since the
                                               custodial parent did not execute, and P could not and did not
                                               attach to his return, any Form 8332 or equivalent release, P
                                               is not entitled under I.R.C. sec. 152(e)(2)(A) to claim the
                                               dependency exemption deduction or the child tax credit. Held,
                                               further, where both the custodial parent and the noncustodial
                                               parent have claimed for the same year a dependency exemp-
                                               tion deduction for the same child, a declaration signed by the
                                               custodial parent after the period of limitations for assess-
                                               ments has expired as to the custodial parent could not qualify
                                               under I.R.C. sec. 152(e)(2)(A), and therefore there is no reason
                                               to grant P’s request to leave the record open so that he may
                                               obtain and proffer such a declaration. Held, further, P is not
                                               entitled to head-of-household filing status under I.R.C. sec.
                                               2(b)(1) nor to the child tax credit under I.R.C. sec. 24.

                                         GUSTAFSON, Judge: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
                                      determined a deficiency of $3,136 in the 2009 Federal income
                                      tax of petitioner Michael Keith Shenk. Mr. Shenk petitioned
                                      this Court, pursuant to section 6213(a), 1 for redetermination
                                      of the deficiency. After Mr. Shenk’s concession that he
                                      received but did not report $254 in dividend income, the
                                      issue for decision is whether Mr. Shenk is entitled to a
                                      dependency exemption deduction for one of his children
                                      under section 151(c), a child tax credit for that child under
                                      section 24(a), and head-of-household filing status under sec-
                                      tion 2(b)(1). On these issues, we hold for the IRS.
