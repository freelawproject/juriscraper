            A village may impose both civil and criminal penalties for violations of local zoning laws, although criminal penalties must be consistent with the designation and classification of offenses under the Penal Law.  A village may provide for increased penalties for subsequent convictions, but may not designate any such offense as a felony.  The disgorgement of profits upon conviction of a zoning violation may be obtained through an alternate sentence under the Penal Law, or through enactment of a carefully crafted civil forfeiture law.          </td>

The exemption set forth in CPLR § 8017 applies only to the county served by the clerk with whom papers are to be filed.

The county clerk may correct an obvious clerical error and remove erroneously recorded documents from the record, taking whatever steps are deemed necessary to avoid confusion as a result of the removal.          </td>
