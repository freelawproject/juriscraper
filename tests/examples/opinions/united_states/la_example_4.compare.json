For the reasons that follow, we find the lower courts erred in relying on Cooper and now hold that the three-year prescriptive period for actions for compensation for property taken by the state set forth in La.

    "summaries": "(Parish of East Baton Rouge) On June 27, 2007, a grand jury indicated defendant Dacarius Holliday (\"defendant\") for the first-degree murder of two-year-old Darian Coon. On March 14, 2010, a unanimous jury found defendant guilty as charged. On March 17, 2010, the jury unanimously determined that defendant be sentenced to death, finding the following aggravating circumstances proven beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) the offender was engaged in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of second-degree cruelty to juveniles and (2) the victim was under the age of twelve (12) years. See La. R.S. 14:30 (A)(1) and (5) and La. R.S. 14:93.2.3. This is defendant's direct appeal pursuant to La. Const. art. V, \u00a75(D). Defendant raises 52 assignments of error, variously combined into 29 arguments, all of which will be addressed herein. After a thorough review of the law and the evidence contained in the record before this Court, we find that none of the arguments set forth by defendant constitute reversible error. Accordingly, for reasons that follow, we affirm the defendant's first-degree murder conviction and sentence of death. AFFIRMED.",
