The trial court properly informed defendant at the sentencing hearing and in the sentencing entry that he was subject to mandatory postrelease control, and therefore, defendant's sentences were not void. The trial court conflated the concepts of postrelease control and parole and made contradictory statements regarding the mandatory nature of postrelease control during the plea hearing, but defendant failed to demonstrate that his pleas were not made knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently because he could not show prejudice as a result of the court's errors. Because defendant's sentences were jointly-recommended nonmandatory consecutive sentences, the trial court was not required to make the consecutive-sentences findings.

The trial court's denial of defendant's motion to compel and subpoenas requesting surveillance video footage did not violate defendant's right to compulsory process or amount to a suppression of favorable evidence because the video footage was irrelevant to the question of defendant's guilt or punishment. The trial court did not err in allowing a child witness to testify via remote video where the witness qualified as a \"victim\" under R.C. 2945.481, there was competent and credible evidence supporting the court's finding that one of the conditions in 2945.481(E) existed, the witness testified under oath and was subject to cross-examination, and there is no evidence that the witness's demeanor was not observable by the jury. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing a witness qualified as an expert in forensic interviewing to testify that the victim's behaviors were consistent with those of other sexually-abused children. The trial court did not err in admitting text messages sent between defendant and the victim where defendant's text messages represented nonhearsay admissions of a party-opponent, the victim's statements were admissible to provide context, and the victim testified at trial about the text messages and was subject to cross-examination. Testimony that the family had been evicted from their home potentially constituted bad-acts evidence inadmissible under Evid.R. 404(B), but the admission of such testimony was not obvious error that affected the outcome of the trial. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial based upon his contention that the jury viewed him being escorted out of the courtroom by sheriff's deputies while wearing handcuffs; any viewing that did occur was brief and inadvertent, and the court instructed the jury to decide the case upon the facts and jury instructions and not to be swayed by sympathy or prejudice. Defendant's right to due process was not violated by the time periods alleged in the indictments because the time periods were not so overly broad as to prevent defendant from presenting an effective defense. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the state to amend the time period alleged in count seven of the indictment in the case numbered B-1800423 because the amendment did not change the identity of the charge or the nature of the conduct alleged and defendant had already been put on notice by the other charges that he would have to defend against allegations of abuse during the amended time period. Defendant's convictions for rape, sexual battery, and gross sexual imposition were based upon sufficient evidence and not against the manifest weight of the evidence where the victim testified to specific, distinguishable instances of sexual conduct and sexual contact with defendant around the time periods alleged in the indictments, and the totality of the evidence shows the jury did not clearly lose its way and create a manifest miscarriage of justice. Defendant failed to demonstrate that his sentences were contrary to law where the trial court made the required consecutive-sentencing findings at the sentencing hearing and in the sentencing entry, and defendant failed to show that the trial court did not comply with R.C. 2929.11 or 2929.12.",

Defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to challenge the child's competence to testify because the child's testimony did not place his competence into question. The trial court did not err in concluding that a child under ten was competent to testify because the child understood the difference between the truth and a lie and the importance of telling the truth. The trial court did not err in accepting defendant's waiver of a competency hearing where defense counsel withdrew the suggestion of incompetency and assured the court that defendant was competent based upon their interactions and communications. The evidence was insufficient to support defendant's conviction on count four, engaging in fellatio with a child under ten, where the state failed to prove venue beyond a reasonable doubt: the state presented no evidence as to the street name, city, or county where the offense occurred. The trial court's judgment on counts two and six for rape of a child under ten was supported by sufficient evidence where the child testified that the conduct occurred more than once. Defendant's convictions were not against the manifest weight of the evidence where the child witness was competent to testify and the factfinder believed the child's testimony. The trial court did not err in sentencing defendant where the sentence was supported by the record, was not contrary to law, and did not violate the Eight Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The trial court did not err in imposing consecutive sentences where the court made the requisite findings under R.C. 2919.14, but the court erred by not incorporating the findings in the sentencing entry. The trial court erred by imposing a no-contact order where the defendant was sentenced to life in prison without parole.",

Defendant's conviction for child endangerment was based on sufficient evidence because it is within common knowledge that lifting a small child by his neck to slam him face-first on the trunk of a car creates a substantial risk to the child's health and safety. Defendant's convictions for child endangerment and domestic violence were not against the manifest weight of the evidence because defendant's behavior was not protected by the affirmative defense of reasonable parental discipline considering the totality of the circumstances. The trial court erred when it failed to merge defendant's convictions for domestic violence and child endangerment because the offenses were of similar import and significance, and were not committed separately or with separate animus or motivation.",
