Q2) Can a city, by ordinance, add two additional members to the utility commission for a total of seven commissioners? RESPONSE: I take it that your questions involve a utility commission created to operate a city's waterworks and/or electric light plant systems pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. sec. 14-201-101 et seq. With that understanding, the answer to your first question is \"yes,\" such a commission must have five, and only five, commissioners. Accordingly, the answer to your second question is \"no.\"",

Code Ann. sec. 25-19-101 et seq.? RESPONSE: Because I have not seen any records that would be responsive to the FOIA request, I cannot opine about the releasability of any specific document or the need to redact any specific piece of information from an otherwise disclosable document. However, it is my opinion that your specific objection about the age of the records at issue is not a legally cognizable exemption to prevent the records' disclosure under the FOIA. Moreover, it has been the general stance of this office that there is no clear basis under the test regarding personnel records to require the redaction of images of public employees' signatures. Under the limited facts before me, I can see no reason to deviate from that general rule in this instance.",

Code Ann. ? 21-2-101 et seq.? RESPONSE: No. The Arkansas Code contains no provision directing a city council member to execute and file a duplicate oath of office.

RESPONSE: The answer to your question depends upon the language of the ordinance by which the sales and use tax was levied and the ballot title by which it was presented to the electorate. These matters are local in nature and must be resolved on the local level. I cannot construe or interpret such documents and I consequently cannot opine on the legality of the proposed use of the tax proceeds. I will, however, briefly address the basic legal framework that guides the review.",

Since [the school boards lacks] this authority does that remove [its] legal authority to go into executive session where discussions of those matters had traditionally taken place? Q2) Are there any circumstances, while the HWHSD remains Level V, in which the Board of Directors can go into executive session? Q3) If the answer to question 2 is yes, what are those circumstances and what is the subject matter in those circumstances that the Board of Directors could discuss out of public view? RESPONSE: Q1-3) If a governing body lacks authority to consider any of the personnel matters that may properly be considered in executive session, then it cannot legally hold a closed meeting pursuant to the FOIA's personnel exemption. But as I do not act as a factfinder in issuing opinions, I cannot address any factual questions that your background statements might invite. I consequently cannot opine on your remaining questions, as they depend largely upon the specific surrounding facts.",
