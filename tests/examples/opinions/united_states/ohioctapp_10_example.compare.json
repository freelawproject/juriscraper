The trial court did not err in allowing testimony of alleged vouching for the victim by the treating physician as the record indicates the physician's testimony did not constitute improper vouching. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in instructing the jury that a witness was provided information about other witnesses' testimony during the trial as the trial court reasonably concluded there was a violation of the separation order under Evid.R. 615. The trial court did not err in excluding records from Franklin County Children Services and National Youth Advocate Program. The trial court did not err in failing to inquire into appellant's request to represent himself at trial as the record indicates that appellant never properly invoked the right to self-representation. Claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel was not meritorious because appellant failed to meet his burden of showing prejudice pursuant to Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).

Because he submitted no evidence of what mitigating evidence existed that his counsel allegedly failed to present, he could not show that the failure to do so was prejudicial. The trial court's decision did not \"summarily deny\" appellant's claims because it was sufficiently detailed to allow appellant review. Judgment affirmed.",
