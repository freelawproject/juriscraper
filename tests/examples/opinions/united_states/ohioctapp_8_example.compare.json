The agency provided case-plan services and supportive-visitation services and although the children were placed in a foster home almost three hours away, the record showed the agency made extensive efforts to facilitate visitation with their mother and their former legal custodian. Mother failed to demonstrate that she received ineffective assistance of trial counsel with regard to trial counsel's decision not to pursue legal custody to an interested individual. The juvenile court's determination that an award of permanent custody is in the best interest of each child was supported by clear and convincing evidence in the record and was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Although the children's former legal custodian completed case-plan services and was reunified with her biological children, the record reflected that the juvenile court considered and weighed all relevant best-interest factors under R.C. 2151.414(D)(1) and other relevant factors in deciding whether to award permanent custody.",

Testimony of victim is sufficient, if believed, to support conviction of rape. However, where multiple witnesses corroborate different aspects of witnesses' testimony, appellate court cannot find that convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence. Further, trial court erred in admitting the testimony of appellant's ex-girlfriend as to his sexual activity where the evidence did not go to modus operandi or plan. Other acts evidence is inadmissible unless it is a) relevant to the nonpropensity purpose for which it is being introduced; b) admitted to prove/supporting an issue that is actually in dispute in the case at hand; and c) there is evidence that i) the act occurred and ii) the defendant committed the act. Whether the probative value of the other acts evidence outweighs the prejudicial effect of the evidence only becomes an issue if the evidence survives this initial threshold of admissibility. However, the admission of the evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, where the remaining evidence was strong and there was no reason to believe that the evidence was so bizarre or abhorrent that it caused the jury to convict based on their judgment of the defendant's character rather than weighing the evidence. When other acts are properly admitted, trial courts should introduce a limiting instruction to explain to the jury the permitted use of the evidence. However, a trial court is not required to give the instruction, because there may be strategic reasons that appellant has not requested an instruction. Counsel's failure to request limiting instruction is not ineffective assistance of counsel when trial strategy was to question the credibility of the victim and requesting a limiting instruction would have unnecessarily focused the jury on the other acts evidence possibly to appellant's detriment.",

However, the thrust of appellant's sole assignment of error is that the trial court violated his right to due process by imposing a condition of community control that restricted his visitation with his minor daughter. Because the sole assignment of error pertains to a purported due process violation that predates the October 14, 2020 order denying appellant's motion to modify the specific community control condition, the issue is outside the scope of the instant appeal. Further, because appellant's core argument, in the present appeal, pertains to a purported due process violation flowing from the December 2019 imposition of the condition in his sentence, it is now untimely and barred by the doctrine of res judicata.

On review, the appellate court, therefore, was permitted to examine all the evidence to determine whether an integrated contract was created.

Ohio's Public Records Act, codified in R.C. 149.43, provides that upon request a public office shall make copies of the requested public record available to the requester at cost and within a reasonable period of time. Ohio courts construe the public records act liberally in favor of broad access, with any doubt resolved in favor of disclosure of public records. R.C. 2743.75 provides an expeditious and economical procedure that attempts to resolve disputes alleging a denial of access to public records. A requester must establish entitlement to relief in an action filed in the Court of Claims under R.C. 2743.75 by clear and convincing evidence. In the specific context of public-records-access appeals filed pursuant to R.C. 2743.75(G)(1), Ohio's courts of appeals have applied the standard of appellate review applicable to such mixed questions of law and fact, reviewing the application of a claimed exemption de novo while according due deference to the trial court's factual determinations. Appellant argues that the Court of Claims erred when it dismissed his complaint and specifically contends that the Court of Claims should have ordered the prosecutor's office to conduct an in camera search of a former assistant prosecutor's private email account to uncover email communications appellant believes exists between the former employee and a government witness. However, although an email message in a public office account readily satisfies the first two prongs of the definition of \"record\" in R.C. 149.011(G), as a \"document, device, or item,\" that is \"created or received by or coming under the jurisdiction\" of the office, the emails appellant sought did not meet the third prong of the definition. The sought-after email would have satisfied the definition of a record if the served to \"document the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the public office.\" The prosecutor's office produced 572 pages of email communications, from its email server, responsive to appellant's Request No. 3 and advised appellant that it had no records that were responsive to Request Nos. 1 and 2. In the motion to dismiss, the prosecutor's office attached the affidavit of its former employee, who averred that he had not conducted any business of the prosecutor's office with the email address provided by his then employer and that he had no emails related to his duties as an assistant prosecutor on his personal Yahoo email account. The former employee specifically averred that he searched his private email account, using the criteria appellant provided, but uncovered no emails that relate to any case or matter involving the prosecutor's office or to his employment or duties with that office. A public office has no duty to provide records that do not exist, or that it does not possess. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the prosecutor's office may be presumed to have performed its duties including public records identification and retrieval regularly and in a lawful manner. After our review, we conclude that appellant failed to meet his burden under R.C. 2743.75 by clear and convincing evidence that sought-after records exist on the former employee's private email account. As such, the Court of Claims did not err when it dismissed appellant's complaint.",

Because appellant could have raised the dormancy argument in his 2018 motion, he is barred by res judicata from raising it in a successive similar motion in 2020.",

Appellees sufficiently pled their defenses and it was not error where the trial court found that appellees did not waive their affirmative defenses. Appellant's argument that the trial court erred in determining that this court had not rendered judgment in its prior case had no merit where, in a prior appeal, one assignment of error was dispositive of the remaining nine assignments of error. The remaining nine assignments of error, which challenged the court's grant of summary judgment, were moot but that finding did not overturn the trial court's judgment. In its prior case, appellant failed to show that appellant was in possession of the original notes at the time the complaint was filed. The amendment to R.C. 1308.38 does not apply retroactively. In the instant case, appellant failed to attach the proper allonges to the copy of the notes. The trial court's grant of summary judgment as to the notes was proper, and the trial court did not err in its finding that appellant was unable to enforce the notes. Appellant is unable to enforce the note and is therefore unable to enforce the obligation it secures \u2014 the mortgage. Likewise, appellant is not the party entitled to enforce the notes and therefore is not a party to the guarantees and not entitled to enforce the guarantees securing the notes. Appellant, unable to enforce the notes, is not entitled to an equitable mortgage; appellant did not plead mistake. The trial court's finding that equitable subrogation does not apply was proper. Appellant filed its motion to amend the complaint more than a year after the original complaint was filed and was only done so after summary judgment had been granted in appellees' favor. It was not an abuse of discretion where the trial court denied appellant's motion for leave to amend the complaint. Appellant was not deprived of a full opportunity to litigate its claims or issues in this case. A final judgment was granted in the prior case of this consolidated appeal; both cases involved the same parties; the claims litigated in this case were litigated in the prior case; and both cases shared the same operative facts. The trial court did not err when it granted appellees' motion for summary judgment on the grounds of res judicata.",
