    "summaries": "Prior to this non-jury trial, defendant served an offer of judgment, which plaintiff rejected. At the close of plaintiff's case in chief, the trial judge granted defendant's motion for involuntary dismissal under 4:37-2(b). Defendant then applied for counsel fees and costs pursuant to 4:58-6, which the judge denied. The court holds that because a successful motion under 4:37-2(b) results in the \"dismissal of the action\" and no verdict in the plaintiff's favor is rendered, the denial of fees and costs was manifestly correct. The policy reasons underlying the zero-recovery exceptions to 4:58-3(c) would be undermined if such fee-shifting were permitted.",

    "summaries": "This appeal concerns the interpretation and application of N.J.S.A. 15A:2.1(d), a provision within the New Jersey Nonprofit Corporation Act, N.J.S.A. 15A:1-1 to 14-26. In relevant part, Section 2.1(d) states: No corporation organized under this act shall have or issue capital stock or shares. No dividend shall be paid and . . . but a corporation may pay compensation in a reasonable amount to its members . . . for services rendered, may pay interest on loans or other credit advances by members . . . [and] may confer benefits on its members in conformity with its purposes . . . . [(emphasis added).] Plaintiff paid $7,500 to become a member of defendant Atlantis Yacht Club, a nonprofit organization formed under N.J.S.A. 15A-2.1. His payment was memorialized in a Certificate of Interest (\"COI\"). In 2015, plaintiff informed the Club he was withdrawing as a member. Pursuant to the Club's by-laws, upon his withdrawal plaintiff would be eligible to receive a repayment from the Club to \"redeem\" his COI at such time when a new member joined. By the time plaintiff withdrew in 2015, the Club had raised its membership fee to $25,000. Under the extant by-laws, the Club was authorized to pay plaintiff (subject to adjustments for any unpaid charges) the amount of the new member's fee, minus a $5,000 capital assessment, for a net sum of $20,000. When a new member eventually joined in 2020, the Club notified plaintiff that it would pay him the $20,000 redemption amount in installments over three years. The Club accordingly paid plaintiff a first installment in 2020 of $3,333.33, informing him that his second- and third-year annual payments in 2021 and 2022 would each be $8,333.33. Before the second-year installment to plaintiff was due in July 2021, the Club had what is described as a \"compliance review\" conducted by a law firm. The firm advised the Club that making such a payment to withdrawing members at a higher amount than their original membership fee would risk the Club's nonprofit status. That advice prompted the Club to rescind its scheduled installment payments to plaintiff. Plaintiff sued the Club to enforce its promise to pay him the additional installments. The Law Division judge ruled in plaintiff's favor. The Club now appeals. The novel legal question presented is whether the payment arrangement was, as the Club contends, an illegal contract because it would entail the \"distribution\" to a member of \"income or profit of the corporation\" disallowed for nonprofits under N.J.S.A. 15A:2\u20131(d). The court affirms the trial judge's decision. The funds a new member pays the Club for a COI is a form of collateral to secure against future sums the member may owe the Club. Any higher amount paid to the withdrawing member at the time of the COI's redemption is not \"income or profit of the corporation\" within the meaning of N.J.S.A. 15A:2-1(d).",

    "summaries": "In this guardianship action, defendant appeals from a January 7, 2022 judgment that terminated her parental rights to her two biological children, who have resided in a non-adoptive home since shortly after their removal in March 2019. At the time of trial, the Division's plan for the children was termination of parental rights followed by placement with their maternal relatives in Dubai. Concurrently, the Division was exploring select home adoption. At trial, the Division elicited hearsay testimony and lay opinion from the adoption caseworker concerning the Division's conversations with the consulate and unspecified attorneys in Dubai. Referencing those conversations, the worker testified that placement with the maternal relatives was not a viable option for the children under Dubai law unless the court makes certain findings about defendant's inability to care for the children and defendant consented to the transfer. The trial judge relied on that hearsay testimony and lay opinion to find there were no alternatives to termination under the second part of prong three of the best interests of the child test, N.J.S.A. 30:4C-15.1(a)(3). The court concludes the admission of the caseworker's testimony constituted harmful error. The feasibility of adoption or a Kinship Legal Guardianship (KLG)-type arrangement under United Arab Emirates law is best elicited through expert testimony. Further, it appears the testimony elicited by the Division at trial may not have been accurate. Post-judgment, the Division has been exploring placement with the maternal relatives in Dubai \u2013 in the absence of defendant's consent. Because the Division's plan appears to be a form of KLG, the Division has not clearly and convincingly proven all alternatives to termination have been ruled out. The court therefore remands the matter to the trial judge to reopen the guardianship proceedings. On remand, the judge should consider whether adoption or a KLG-type custodial arrangement with the maternal relatives in Dubai is feasible under Dubai law only after considering the testimony from a qualified expert; and whether, under the current circumstances, termination would not do more harm than good, under the fourth prong, N.J.S.A. 30:4C-15.1(a)(4). The court does not foreclose the judge from considering whether defendant has continued therapeutic services and whether she could safely parent the children in the foreseeable future under the second prong, N.J.S.A. 30:4C-15.1(a)(2).",

    "summaries": "This appeal pertains to the civil personal injury prosecution of statutory and common law claims arising from allegations of sexual abuse committed fifty-five years ago against a child by his sister, who also was a minor when the acts occurred. In 2019, the New Jersey Legislature enacted the Child Victims Act (CVA), 2019, 120, which supplemented and amended the statute of limitations for statutory and common law causes of actions for sexual abuse. The CVA enacted two statutes of limitations that expanded the time for filing personal injury claims resulting from the commission of one of the following four enumerated sexual offenses: (1) \"the commission of sexual assault\"; (2) \"any other crime of a sexual nature\"; (3) \"a prohibited sexual act as defined in [N.J.S.A. 2A:30B-2]\"; (4) \"or sexual abuse as defined in [the Child Sexual Abuse Act (CSAA), N.J.S.A. 2A:61B-1].\" N.J.S.A. 2A:14-2a; N.J.S.A. 2A:14-2b. Pertinent to this appeal is the enacted statute of limitations which provided a two-year revival window for victims to file otherwise time-barred claims for sexual crimes committed against them when they were minors. N.J.S.A. 2A:14-2b. The court considered the dismissal of plaintiff's CSAA claims, concluding a derivative statutory passive abuser claim against a parent was properly dismissed by the motion judge as not cognizable under the CSAA because the alleged sexual abuse was committed by a minor. Because the CSAA defines sexual abuse as sexual contact or sexual penetration committed by an adult, a CSAA claim alleging sexual assault by minor does not present a valid cause of action. The court further considered the motion judge's dismissal of plaintiff's common law claims stemming from the alleged sexual abuse committed by a minor, which were timely filed under the two-year revival window. The court concluded the common law claims are actionable independent of the CSAA.",

    "summaries": "This administrative appeal concerns a State roadway project's alteration of a commercial property owner's access to a State highway. It is the first published opinion to address certain provisions adopted in 2018 that extensively revised the State Highway Access Management Code (the \"Access Code\"), N.J.A.C. 16:47-1.1 to -14.1. The pivotal legal issue concerns whether the roadway project's replacement of appellant's direct access to State Highway 66 through an existing driveway with access through a shared driveway connecting to an adjacent landowner's parcel comprises a \"revocation\" or \"removal\" of appellant's means of access, or, alternatively, whether the change is simply a \"modification\" of access. The configuration will enable motorists going to appellant's property from Route 66 to turn into the shared driveway, briefly travel on an easement through the adjacent property, and then branch off to an internal driveway on appellant's lot leading to appellant's commercial building. The court affirms the Department of Transportation's final agency decision deeming the new configuration a \"modification\" of appellant's access to Route 66, rather than a \"revocation\" of access under N.J.S.A. 27:7-94, or a \"removal\" of access under N.J.A.C. 16:47-2.1. Under the revised 2018 version of the Access Code, the configuration is a modification because it entails \"replacing all ingress or all egress between a State highway and a lot or site with ingress or egress via a private easement on a different lot or site.\" N.J.A.C. 16-47-2.1. The configuration is not a revocation or a removal because it does not eliminate all access to Route 66 and does not require motorists to traverse another public street in order to connect to appellant's premises. The Department did not misapply its authority and regulatory expertise in deeming the roadway changes a modification.",

N.J.A.C. 11:1-37.1.

The court reviewed PALA's legislative history and found no evidence the Legislature intended public adjuster contracts contain provisions for cancellation at any time. The plain language of the regulations only requires that public adjuster contracts set forth the procedures to be followed in the event of a cancellation and advise consumers of their rights in the event of cancellation. Therefore, the commissioner misinterpreted the regulations, and her findings were ultra vires of her authority under PALA. As a result, the court reversed the findings appellants violated N.J.A.C. 11:1-37.13(b)(5)(i) and (ii) and remanded for a recalculation of the penalties and costs imposed on appellants.",

The State sought to admit the testimony to prove aggravated assault and child endangerment charges against defendants Darryl Nieves and Michael Cifelli, fathers of infant sons who exhibited associated symptoms while in their respective fathers' care. Following a hearing in the Nieves matter pursuant to , 293 F. 1013 (D.C.

The court affirmed the judge's decision in , holding that the State failed to establish SBS/AHT's general acceptance within the medical community through expert testimony, supporting authoritative scientific studies, and judicial opinions. Where, as here, the underlying theory integrates multiple scientific disciplines, the proponent must establish cross-disciplinary validation to establish reliability. The State failed to do that here. Despite its seeming acceptance in the pediatric medical community, the evidence showed a real dispute surrounding the hypothesis that the biomechanical principles underlying SBS/AHT actually supported the conclusion that shaking only can cause the injuries associated with SBS/AHT.",

By leave granted, the State challenged an order suppressing all intercepted communications that followed the interception of a privileged marital communication between one of the defendants and his codefendant spouse. The trial court entered the order under N.J.S.A. 2A:156A-21, which in pertinent part mandates the suppression of \"the entire contents of all intercepted wire, electronic[,] or oral communications obtained during or after any interception\" that is \"unlawfully intercepted\" or \"not made in conformity with\" the wiretap order or authorization. N.J.S.A. 2A:156A-21(a) and (c). The court affirms the order based on its interpretation of the Act. The State concedes that at the time of the interception of the initial privileged marital communication, N.J.R.E. 509 did not include a crime-fraud exception, and, as a result, the initial and subsequent 305 intercepted privileged marital communications are inadmissible at defendants' trial under the then-extant version of N.J.R.E. 509. The State argues interception of the initial privileged marital communication did not trigger the mandatory suppression of all subsequent wiretap interceptions during the investigation under N.J.S.A. 2A:156A-21 because interception of the privileged marital communication was neither unlawful nor made in violation of the wiretap orders. The court concludes that not every interception of a privileged marital communication is unlawful and requires application of N.J.S.A. 2A:156A-21's suppression remedy. The court finds incidental interceptions of privileged communications during the mandatory intrinsic minimization process attendant to the execution of every wiretap order are anticipated by, and authorized by, the Act, and do not trigger N.J.S.A. 2A:156A-21's suppression remedy. The court holds that, because the State Police knew the initial interception was of a communication between married spouses, made no effort to minimize the interception, and monitored the communication beyond the time necessary to determine if it was privileged, the interception was unlawful under the Act and violated the wiretap order, which expressly required minimization. The court rejects the State's argument suppression is not required because the initial marital communication, and the 305 subsequent marital communications, were intercepted based on the good faith but erroneous belief the crime-fraud exception recommended by the Court in , 218 N.J. 224 (2014), and later enacted, N.J.S.A. 2A:84A-22(2)(e), 2015, 138, \u00a7 2, eff.

New Jersey Supreme Court precedent permits civil courts to resolve controversies involving religious groups if resolution can be achieved by reference to neutral principles of law and does not require the interpretation of religious doctrine. Defendant agreed in the MSA to abide by the ruling, whatever that might be.

    "summaries": "In this appeal from an order denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized following the 5:00 a.m. execution of a knock-and-announce search warrant at a residence, the court finds the law enforcement officers did not wait a reasonable period after knocking and announcing their presence before forcibly breaching and entering the home's front door. The court determines that based on the circumstances presented, the officers' forcible entry into the home after waiting less than five seconds after after knocking and announcing their presence was unreasonable and rendered the subsequent search of the home and seizure of evidence unconstitutional. The court determines the exclusionary rule requires suppression of the evidence, reverses the order denying the suppression motion, and remands for further proceedings.",

    "summaries": "Plaintiff, who is incarcerated at a federal prison located in New Jersey, wants to marry someone who is incarcerated at a federal prison located in a different state. He sued the New Hanover Township Municipal Clerk and Registrar, claiming she had violated his civil rights contrary to the New Jersey Civil Rights Act, N.J.S.A. 10:6-1 to -2, by applying the requirement in N.J.S.A. 37:1-7 and -8 that couples appear in person to obtain a marriage license. He appeals an order denying his motion for a preliminary injunction and granting defendant's cross-motion to dismiss the complaint. He argues the enforcement of the in-person requirement was unconstitutional and contends the motion judge should have used his equitable powers to enjoin enforcement of the requirement. The court rejects both arguments. The court holds the statutes at issue do not create an unconstitutional bar of a prisoner's right to marry but instead apply to individuals who want to marry and are reasonably related to the legitimate goal of ensuring the validity of marriages. The court also holds the motion judge could not have used his equitable powers to enjoin defendant's enforcement of the statutory in-person requirement. Accordingly, the court affirms the dismissal of plaintiff's complaint and the denial of plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction.",

    "summaries": "On February 23, 2017, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) issued a flood hazard area applicability determination (FHA Determination) to Hampton Farm, LLC (Hampton Farm). Shortly thereafter, appellant Musconetcong Watershed Association (MW Association) requested the DEP to conduct an adjudicatory hearing so it could challenge the FHA Determination. Four years later, on April 6, 2021, the DEP denied that request. MW Association timely appealed from the April 6, 2021 decision. It also sought leave to appeal from the February 23, 2017 FHA Determination, contending it had become final when the DEP denied MW Association's request for a hearing. On an interlocutory motion, a two-judge panel of the court denied leave. The court now reconsiders, reverses that interlocutory ruling, and grants leave to appeal. The court holds that the DEP's FHA Determination became a final agency decision subject to appeal when the DEP denied MW Association's request for an adjudicatory hearing to challenge the FHA Determination. At that time, all administrative remedies were exhausted. To address the DEP's four-year time delay in deciding MW Association's request for an adjudicatory hearing, the court holds that any party, including a third-party objector, has the right to petition the DEP to rule on a pending request for an adjudicatory hearing under N.J.A.C. 1:1-4.1(a). The DEP will then have thirty days from receipt of the petition to \"inform all parties of its determination\" regarding that request. N.J.A.C. 1:1-4.1(a). The court also holds that MW Association did not have a right to an adjudicatory hearing because no statute conferred that right to MW Association, which is a third-party objector, and MW Association did not have a particularized property interest warranting a hearing. Accordingly, the court affirms the April 6, 2021 final agency decision. Finally, because the court has reversed the ruling on the interlocutory motion, the DEP has two options concerning its FHA Determination. It can either (1) elect to address MW Association's challenges to its February 23, 2017 FHA Determination and a new briefing schedule will be issued; or (2) request a remand so it can expand and update the factual findings supporting its FHA Determination.",

In his second amended complaint, plaintiff asserted a defamation claim against Governor Philip D. Murphy. A Law Division judge granted defendants' motion to dismiss the defamation claim, concluding plaintiff had not pleaded the element of actual malice with sufficient specificity. In his fourth amended complaint, plaintiff again asserted a defamation claim against Governor Murphy, referencing in particular statements made during May 29, 2020 and June 1, 2020 press briefings. Defendants moved to dismiss the defamation claim pursuant to Rule 4:6-2(e). The judge denied the motion, concluding plaintiff had pleaded sufficient facts in the fourth amended complaint to demonstrate actual malice. The court reversed, concluding the judge had misapplied the actual-malice standard. After conducting a de novo review, the court held plaintiff's conclusory allegations did not meet the actual-malice standard and, as a result, plaintiff's defamation claim failed. Reversing the denial of defendants' motion to dismiss, the court remanded the case with a direction that the judge enter an order dismissing the defamation claim.",

    "summaries": "Defendant City of Jersey City's (City) Code of Ordinances Section 105 permits any individual to request a \"determination of significance\" from the City's Historic Preservation Officer (HPO) regarding whether a subject building warrants preservation. Consistent with local ordinances, plaintiff, who owns a circa-1900 building in Jersey City, sought a determination of significance before applying for a demolition permit. The City's HPO concluded plaintiff's building likely would not be approved for demolition due to its historic, architectural, and cultural significance. Pursuant to local zoning ordinance, plaintiff appealed to defendant Zoning Board of Adjustment (ZBA), which upheld the determination of significance. Thereafter, he filed a complaint in lieu of prerogative writs in the Law Division alleging defendants' actions were arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable. The Law Division found the ZBA's decision was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable and dismissed the complaint. The court concludes the HPO's issuance of a determination of significance \u2014 an advisory opinion seemingly intended to prevent plaintiff's submission of an application for a demolition permit \u2014 is not a procedure authorized by the Municipal Land Use Law (MLUL), N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 to -163. The MLUL does not authorize HPOs to unilaterally grant or deny historic preservation designations that bind a zoning officer in determining whether a demolition permit shall issue; that advisory function belongs solely to the Historic Preservation Commission, as detailed in the MLUL, and cannot be delegated to other entities or individuals. The Commission, in turn, may designate a site as historic only if it is voted upon by a majority of the full governing body. The court reverses and remands to allow plaintiff to apply for a demolition permit in accordance with the MLUL. The court also concludes Jersey City's Code of Ordinances Sections 105-3, 105-4, and 105-7 are ultra vires and inconsistent with the objectives and procedures concerning historic preservation mandated by the MLUL to the extent they delegate powers reserved for a municipality's historic preservation commission to the HPS.",
