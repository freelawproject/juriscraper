The trial court did not err by finding that the contested provision, which defined the assets subject to inclusion into an irrevocable trust for the benefit of the parties' disabled son, was ambiguous. The trial court also did not err by concluding it was the parties' intent that, upon a party's death, the trust would be funded with one-half of the deceased party's total assets, not just the party's probate assets. The trial court also did not err by concluding that neither party, by entering into the agreement, intended to restrict his or her ability, upon the son's death, to convey as desired any residuary trust assets contributed by that party. But, in order to more efficiently implement the parties' intent, the trial court's judgment is modified to order the appellee/cross-appellant to use an already established trust to comply with the agreement, and the husband's estate is ordered to create a new trust to comply with the agreement.

Appellant is a long-term care facility to which appellee's mother was admitted shortly before her death. Appellant's bill for the mother's care was not paid, resulting in appellant's filing a cause of action against appellee asserting that the transfer of the TOD account constituted a fraudulent transfer under R.C. 1336.05. After a bench trial, the trial court stayed the cause for many months pending completion of the mother's probate estate. Before the probate estate was completed, the trial court lifted the stay and issued a verdict against appellant. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by lifting the stay. The trial court's verdict was based upon its conclusion that the TOD transfer did not make the mother's estate insolvent. This finding was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. This conclusion rendered appellant's request for a constructive trust moot. Judgment affirmed. (Hall, J., concurring in judgment only.)",

After a valid traffic stop for no headlights and taillights, and after learning that appellant lacked a valid driver's license and that her vehicle had fictitious plates, the vehicle was lawfully towed from the \"trafficway.\" Having been lawfully impounded, and pursuant to Sheriff's Office policy, the vehicle was subject to an inventory search, which included the locked glove box, the key to which was in appellant's possession. Since deputies had probable cause to arrest appellant, the \"threat\" to place her in handcuffs in order obtain the key to the glove box cannot be characterized as coercive. Judgment affirmed.",
