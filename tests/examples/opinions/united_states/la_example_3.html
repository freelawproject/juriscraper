                          In this action,  the biological mother of a child placed under guardianship with the child&rsquo;s  paternal great-aunt filed a petition to terminate that guardianship and to  regain custody of the child.&nbsp; Following a  trial conducted over three days, the district court rendered judgment  terminating the guardianship and awarding joint custody of the child to the  guardian and the biological mother, with the mother designated as the  domiciliary custodian.&nbsp; On appeal, the  court of appeal reversed the district court judgment, reinstated the  guardianship, and remanded the case to the district court for purposes of  establishing a visitation schedule for the mother.&nbsp; At the mother&rsquo;s behest, we granted certiorari  to assess whether the correct legal standards were applied by the courts below  and to review the correctness of the district court&rsquo;s determination that the  guardianship should be terminated. Finding that this case highlights the  distinction that exists between custody determinations under the Civil Code and  the guardianship provisions of the Children&rsquo;s Code, we hold that the proper  standard for determining whether an order of guardianship should be modified or  terminated is statutorily prescribed by Article 724 of the Children&rsquo;s Code,  which, in this case, requires proof by the movant/mother by &ldquo;clear and  convincing evidence&rdquo; of &ldquo;a substantial and material change in the circumstances  of the guardian or child&rdquo; because either &ldquo;[c]ontinuation of the guardianship is  so deleterious to the child as to justify a modification or termination of the  relationship&rdquo; or &ldquo;the harm likely to be caused from a change in the  guardianship is substantially outweighed by the advantages to the child of the  modification.&rdquo;&nbsp; La. Ch.C. art. 724(D).&nbsp; Weighing the evidence in light of that  evidentiary burden, we agree with the court of appeal&rsquo;s assessment that the  district court erred in determining that the mother met her burden of proving  the guardianship should be terminated.&nbsp;  Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeal reinstating the  guardianship order. </p>

						    In this medical  malpractice case, the jury declined to find the defendant surgeon&rsquo;s failure to  refer the plaintiff for a cardiac consult before performing non-emergency  gallbladder surgery had caused the patient to suffer a severe heart attack  thirty or so hours later that ultimately necessitated a heart transplant rather  than a heart bypass. Instead, the jury found the plaintiffs had proven the  defendant&rsquo;s breach of the standard of care had resulted in the loss of a chance  of a better outcome. The jury awarded the plaintiffs lump sum general damages,  which the trial court in its judgment made subject to the Medical Malpractice  Act&rsquo;s limitation on the total amount recoverable. The court of appeal found  legal error in the verdict form necessitated de novo review of the damages  awarded. The court of appeal affirmed the jury&rsquo;s determination the plaintiff  had suffered a lost chance of a better outcome and awarded both general damages  and special damages, including past medicals, future medicals, and lost wages.  Because the court of appeal erred in failing to apply the jurisprudence of this  court in determining the damages to be awarded in a lost chance of a better  outcome case, we reverse and reinstate the jury&rsquo;s verdict, its lump sum award  of general damages, and the trial court&rsquo;s judgment.&nbsp; </p>

                          In this case,  we are called upon to decide whether an ordinance of the City of New Orleans  levying a gallonage tax based on volume upon dealers who handle high alcoholic  content beverages is a valid exercise of its authority to levy and collect  occupational license taxes within the meaning of La. Const. Art. VI, &sect; 28,  which permits a local governmental subdivision to impose an occupational  license tax not greater than that imposed by the state. This case is before us  pursuant to our appellate jurisdiction, La. Const. Art. V, &sect; 5(D), because the  ordinance has been declared unlawful and unconstitutional by the trial court.  For the following reasons, we find the portion of the ordinance at issue is not  an unconstitutional exercise of the City&rsquo;s taxing authority. We thus reverse  the trial court&rsquo;s grant of summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, and remand  to the trial court for further proceedings. </p>

							A landowner  brought suit against several mineral lessees for breach of the obligations of  its mineral lease.&nbsp; The mortgagee of one  of the lessees was also named as a defendant. The lower courts held all lessees  and the mortgagee solidarily liable for damages resulting from the failure to  furnish a recordable act evidencing the expiration of the lease, i.e., failure  to release the lease.&nbsp; We granted these  consolidated writ applications to determine (1) whether the mortgagee was  properly held solidarily liable as an &ldquo;owner&rdquo; of the lease under La. Mineral  Code art. 207 and a &ldquo;lessee&rdquo; under La. Mineral Code art. 140; (2) whether the  imposition of solidary liability was correct with regard to the owner of the  shallow rights; (3) whether La. Mineral Code art. 140&rsquo;s calculation of damages  contemplates the inclusion of unpaid royalties (the amount due) in addition to  double the amount of unpaid royalties (as a penalty) or whether the maximum  damage award allowed is twice the amount of unpaid royalties; and (4) whether  $125,000 in attorney fees for work done on appeal is excessive.For the reasons  that follow, we find (1) the mortgagee was not an &ldquo;owner&rdquo; for purposes of La.  Mineral Code art. 207 and is, therefore, not liable for failure to release the  lease.&nbsp; For the same reasons, we find the  mortgagee was not a &ldquo;lessee&rdquo; for purposes of La. Mineral Code art. 140 and, is,  therefore, not liable for failure to pay royalties that were due.&nbsp; (2) We find Tauren is solidarily liable for  the damages because the failure to release the lease is an indivisible  obligation. (3) We hold La. Mineral Code art. 140 authorizes as damages a  maximum of double the amount of unpaid royalties. (4)&nbsp; Last, we amend the award of attorney fees to  reflect our holdings herein. </p>

						    This case  presents the question of whether the defendant was deprived of effective  assistance of counsel where trial counsel failed to investigate and present a  cogent defense of &ldquo;battered woman&rsquo;s syndrome&rdquo; (&ldquo;BWS&rdquo;), including failing to  investigate the benefits of expert testimony concerning BWS. We hold that the  defendant was deprived of effective assistance of counsel in this case, given  the documented evidence of repeated abuse the victim perpetrated upon the  defendant before his death.

							The legislature  has provided no statutorily authorized responsive verdicts to the crime of  second degree kidnapping in La. C.Cr.P. art. 814, and therefore La. C.Cr.P.  art. 815, and its requirement that simple kidnapping be a lesser and included  grade of second degree kidnapping before a verdict of guilty of the former can  be responsive to a charge of the latter, applies by its plain language. Under  State v. Simmons, 01&ndash;0293 (La. 5/14/02), 817 So.2d 16, because reasonable state  of facts can be imagined wherein the greater offense second degree kidnapping  is committed without perpetration of the lesser offense of simple kidnapping, a  verdict of guilty of simple kidnapping is not responsive to a charge of second  degree kidnapping. Because the jury&rsquo;s return of the non-responsive verdicts is  an implicit acquittal of the crimes charged, we reverse the court of appeal and  remand to the trial court to enter a post-verdict judgment of acquittal on the  five counts of second degree kidnapping. </p>
