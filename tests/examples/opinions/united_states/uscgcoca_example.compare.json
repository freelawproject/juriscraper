Appellee is charged with attempted murder, two specifications of carrying a concealed weapon, and one specification of dereliction of duty. Appellee filed a motion to suppress statements he made to shipmates and separately to Coast Guard Investigative Service (CGIS) agents. The military judge granted in part and denied in part the suppression motion. The Government gave timely notice and filed this appeal. The Government asserts: I. The military judge abused his discretion when he found Appellee did not knowingly and intelligently waive his Article 31(b) rights; and II. The military judge misapplied the law when he found the Appellee in custody, thereby triggering the Appellee's Fifth Amendment rights. Furthermore, if the Appellee was in custody, the military judge abused his discretion when determining the Appellee did not knowingly and intelligently waive his Fifth Amendment rights.",

Appellant was sentenced to reduction to E-5 and restriction for 30 days. The convening authority disapproved the restriction,1 leaving only the reduction to E-5. Judgment was entered accordingly. Before this Court, Appellant has assigned as error that Appellant's due process right to timely appellate review was violated when the government delayed providing notice of his right to appeal and ultimately took more than a year to transmit his record of trial to this court. The delay is largely attributable to the loss of the record of trial. Post-Trial Delay: Due Process Appellant asserts his right to due process was violated because 460 days elapsed from the date he had the right of direct appeal until his record of trial was transmitted to this Court, including 373 days that are attributable to the Government.

The alleged error here is considerably more benign than a juror concealing that he already knew facts about the case based on prior participation in a grand jury, Mayer, 235 U.S. at 57, or the foreman of a jury sharing with other jurors unfavorable information about the defendants that had not been introduced at trial, Mills, 221 F.2d at 1203. Yet, as discussed, neither of those was deemed fundamental for purposes of coram nobis. More so here. Despite the members' alleged exposure to the putative victim's emotional outburst, we can presume the members followed the military judge's instruction to \"consider only the evidence presented in open court\" and to \"impartially resolve the ultimate issue of the guilt or innocence of the accused in accordance with the law, the evidence admitted in open court and your own conscience.\" R. at 1302; United States v. Taylor, 53 M.J. 195, 198 (C.A.A.F. 2000). Accordingly, we conclude that Petitioner fails to meet the threshold requirement of showing that the alleged error is of the most fundamental character.
