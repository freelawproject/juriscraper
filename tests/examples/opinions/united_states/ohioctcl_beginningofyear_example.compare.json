    "summaries": "Reverse race discrimination; tortious spoliation of documents. Reviewing the facts, the court determined that plaintiff failed to demonstrate that defendant's stated reasons for his termination were pretext. Plaintiff had two active suspensions at the time of his pre-termination transgressions and plaintiff was charged with dishonesty. Dishonesty alone was sufficient to terminate plaintiff with or without the compounding disciplinary grid. No other similarly situated, minority employee had two active suspensions, nor did any other employee commit a dishonest act. Thus, the court found that there was no genuine issue of material fact that while defendant took an adverse action with respect to plaintiff's employment, there was no evidence to support the claim that it discriminated against non-minority employees and/or treated plaintiff disparately than other similarly situated employees. Next, plaintiff alleged that his former supervisor kept records of defendant's alleged discriminatory practices in his office desk, including a document purportedly used for tracking disparate treatment; that it did not provide these documents to plaintiff in response to a discovery request; and that this led to an inference that defendant destroyed these records. Plaintiff provided no evidence to support his belief. Furthermore, the allegedly destroyed records were part of a public records lawsuit in which the Tenth District Court of Appeals found that plaintiff had failed to properly request the records. Because defendant could not produce documents that didn't exist and plaintiff's failure to provide any evidence that the documents in question were intentionally destroyed, the court found no genuine issue of material fact with regard to any documents related to his supervisor. With regard to certain handwritten notes that defendant allegedly destroyed, the court noted that defendant had destroyed the notes according to its retention schedule prior to any requests for preservation. Accordingly, there was no issue of material fact regarding plaintiff's claim for spoliation of evidence. Consequently, the court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment for both claims.",

Her first objection challenged the magistrate's factual findings, which supported his determination that she had failed to prove her claim of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. The court noted that pursuant to Ohio law, discharging an employee for consulting an attorney may serve as a basis for the public policy exception to the common law employment-at-will doctrine. Certain exhibits that were part of the record demonstrated that defendant's agent knew that plaintiff had retained counsel prior to her termination. However, because plaintiff did not file a transcript along with her objections to the magistrate's factual findings, under Civ. R. 53, the court was required to accept the magistrate's factual findings and limit its review to the magistrate's legal conclusions. Lastly, with regard to plaintiff's second objection alleging defendant's discharge was based on pretext, the court noted that plaintiff's failure to file a transcript compelled it to again adopt the magistrate's findings of fact. Consequently, upon conducting an independent review, the court adopted the previous magistrate's decision and rendered judgment in defendant's favor.",

    "summaries": "Negligence. Plaintiff, an inmate in defendant's custody and control claimed that defendant was negligent in failing to prevent an attack upon him by another inmate. On November 12, 2013, Creech, another inmate in defendant's custody, filled a mug with water and microwaved it for approximately four minutes. Creech then rolled himself in his wheelchair toward the row of beds where he and plaintiff lived, rolled up to plaintiff's bed and stood up, and poured the hot water in plaintiff's mouth and face, who was still sleeping. Upon reviewing the evidence, the magistrate found that defendant did not have actual or constructive notice that the attack was impending. Plaintiff contended that Creech had a disciplinary history and mental illness sufficient to put defendant on notice of an impending attack, but the magistrate found that it was not supported by evidence. Plaintiff had previously spoken to Creech, had not felt that Creech posed a serious threat, and did not notify a staff member about any concern for his safety. Creech had been disciplined for a variety of infractions, but those infractions were accumulated over more than three decades in prison and nearly all of them were non-violent in nature. Based upon annual reviews of Creech's security classification, he was considered to be at the lowest possible security level. While there were records evidencing that Creech was disciplined in 2002 for fighting with another inmate and was disciplined in 2000 for attempting to strike another inmate with a lock attached to a belt over the theft of some cigarettes, these incidents were remote in time-by more than ten years-from the attack on plaintiff. As such, these did not constitute a pattern of violence that could even arguably confer defendant with notice that the attack by Creech was impending at any moment. Moreover, the evidence presented at trial about Creech having received some mental health care or been diagnosed with depression, was no basis to conclude that his attack was foreseeable. Therefore, the magistrate found that plaintiff failed to prove his claims by a preponderance of the evidence and recommended judgment in favor of defendant.",

However, the magistrate also found that plaintiff failed to prove that defendant had actual or constructive notice that the stairway posed an unreasonable risk of harm to plaintiff due to the accumulated ice and snow. Plaintiff did not offer any evidence that defendant was aware of the ice and snow and neither did he inform anyone. It was established that it snowed several days prior to plaintiff's accident, followed by a pattern of warm weather causing the snow to melt.

The magistrate found that the ice and snow accumulation on the stairway and landing did not exist for such length of time to support a finding that defendant had constructive notice of the condition.

Plaintiff, an inmate in the custody and control of defendant, brought an action which arose out of an accident he suffered when his left index finger was severed by a perforator in the Ohio Penal Industries print shop at one of defendant's correctional institutions. Upon reviewing the evidence presented at trial, the magistrate found that the perforator had been in use for many years and had some flaws and caused some inconvenience to operators, but it was periodically serviced, was safe to operate, and no one had been injured on it before. The day of the accident, plaintiff determined that the perforator had a mechanical problem and took it upon himself to resolve the issue. He used a wrench to remove the bolts that held the perforator's gear box in place. Ultimately, when plaintiff was unable to resolve the issue, he turned the perforator back on. When he went to turn it off with his right hand, he failed to pay attention to the left hand and inadvertently suck his left index finger in the gears, severing his finger.The magistrate found that the perforator was safe to operate and but for plaintiff's actions, the gear box was shielded by a safety cover that was bolted down to the machine's frame. Plaintiff did not establish that there were any problems with the machine, and in any case, failed to inform a staff member on duty. As such, plaintiff failed to exercise reasonable care for his own safety. Plaintiff also asserted that the staff knew or should have known that inmates operating the perforator were in the practice of removing the cover from the gear box. However, the evidence demonstrated that the removal of the cover was not such a common practice that defendant's agents should have been on notice.

Upon considering the evidence presented at trial, the magistrate found that plaintiff was familiar with the operation of the two steam kettles in the kitchen, including the fact that each kettle automatically released steam from a release valve when the pressure inside the kettle reached a certain point. By placing his foot underneath the release valve, plaintiff failed to exercise appropriate care for his own safety, and this was the proximate cause of the injury. There was only a small space between the release valve and the floor which plaintiff needed to avoid, and it was not necessary for him to have his foot there in order to perform his clean-up duty of cleaning the wall.

Upon review of the evidence presented at trial, the magistrate found that it was more probably than not that defendant's negligence proximately caused plaintiff to suffer an injury at the L4/L5 level of his spine. As a result of that injury, plaintiff suffered significant pain in his lower back that radiated into his left leg; underwent surgery and other medical treatment for which he incurred some expenses out-of-pocket; and incurred lost wages while off work from approximately February 23, 2010 to October 16, 2010 or 34 weeks in total. However, plaintiff did not establish that a causal relationship existed between defendant's negligence and any ailments he experienced after October 16, 2010. Consequently, the magistrate calculated plaintiff's damages as follows: (1) lost wages in the amount of $35,345.04, representing 34 weeks of lost work; (2) out-of-pocket medical expenses in the amount of $2,489.97, representing medical expenses incurred by plaintiff through October 2010; (3) past pain and suffering in the amount of $35,000; and, (4) the $25 filing fee plaintiff paid to commence this action. Lastly, the magistrate offset plaintiff's recovery by the amount of the settlement in his BWC claim ($40,000) and by the amount of the short-term disability income he received in 2010 ($10,939.20), for a total reduction of $50,939.20.",

Plaintiff was hired by defendant in 2008 as an associated professor, a tenure track position, in defendant's Department of Pathology in the College of Medicine. Plaintiff began the tenure review process in the summer of 2011. The department chair, college dean, Provost, University President, and the Board of Trustees were all against a tenure decision for plaintiff. Plaintiff appealed the tenure denial to the Committee on Academic Freedom and Responsibility (CAFR). After consideration, the CAFR found reasonable adequate grounds indicating that plaintiff's tenure evaluation was improper and thereby referred plaintiff's appeal to the University Faculty Hearing Committee. The Committee agreed with the CAFR's findings, and reported its findings to the university's then-Provost and the University's then-President. The Provost received the Committee's findings; disagreed with them; and confirmed his original finding that plaintiff's tenure should be denied, effectively resulting in plaintiff's termination. It is the steps, or lack thereof, taken by the Provost after the Committee issued its findings and recommendations that gave rise to plaintiff's claim for breach of contract and her related conversion claim. Prior to trial, the parties stipulated that plaintiff's employment contract consisted of her offer letter and various faculty incorporated rules, and the 2006 Department of Pathology AP&T Document. Upon review, the court found that the faculty rules did not grant the Provost authority to disregard the Committee's findings and not grant a new, fair and impartial evaluation. While \"new, fair and impartial\" were not defined, there was no evidence that the definition of these three terms were anything different from their common meaning. As the terms were not clear and unambiguous, the court found that defendant's failure to provide her with her contractual right to a new, fair and impartial evaluation constituted a breach of plaintiff's employment contract. However, the court agreed with defendant in that because of the unusual nature of the case, damages could not be proved with reasonable certainty at that juncture. Once the promised evaluation was held, the court could then determine an appropriate damage amount. Lastly, plaintiff claimed that when her employment with defendant university ended, it failed to return to her equipment she possessed and used in her research. The court found that the property in question was either owned by the sponsor or defendant, not by the plaintiff. The only way plaintiff could have a right to possess the equipment was to have the sponsor or defendant give her permission to take control of the property, which plaintiff did not obtain. As such, the court denied plaintiff's conversion claim.",

Moreover, pursuant to the holding in Ries v. Ohio State Univ. Med.

    "summaries": "Negligence. Plaintiff was an inmate in defendant's custody and control. Plaintiff, a diabetic, who walked with the aid of a cane and had his arm in a sling, was walking to inmate health services (IHS) to get his blood checked. On his way to IHS, plaintiff slipped and fell on an accumulation of snow and ice in the walkway. The magistrate issued a judgment in plaintiff's favor and defendant filed objections. The court overruled defendant's first objection, because other than stating multiple times in its objections that there was no evidence that plaintiff was prevented from taking an alternative route to the infirmary, defendant did not provide any evidence contrary to plaintiff's testimony that inmates could only take one path to IHS. Furthermore, no snow removal was completed prior to the time plaintiff fell, and consequently, other routes available to plaintiff were likely snow covered. The court overruled defendant's second objection because the dangerous condition, which defendant had constructive notice of, was not simply an incline or decline in a path. Rather it was a bad spot that was \"swampy\" during wintertime and there was an accumulation of snow on the walk plaintiff was required to use. This posed an unreasonable risk to plaintiff because he ambulated with a cane, had his arm in a sling, and the court agreed with the magistrate that walking across an ice-covered depression posed an unreasonable risk of harm to plaintiff. Lastly, the court also overruled defendant's third objection. The court reviewed plaintiff's legal status and determined that the magistrate did not err in determining that plaintiff was not a traditional \"invitee\" and was not always free, as an invitee would be, to refrain from traversing the accumulation of ice and snow or assume the risk of doing so. Consequently, the court adopted the magistrate's prior decision and recommendation as its own.",

    "summaries": "Age discrimination. The court found no error in the prior magistrate's decision and recommendation. Initially, the court noted that plaintiffs' objections were too long and exceeded the 15-page limitation pursuant to L.C.C.R. 4(E). Furthermore, the objections did not state with particularity all grounds pursuant to Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(b)(ii). As a result, the court identified three separate objections and ruled on them. With regard to direct evidence of age discrimination, the court held that plaintiffs' statistical evidence was insufficient to establish discriminatory intent. Furthermore, the magistrate properly determined that one plaintiff was a member of a collective bargaining unit and under that agreement, he was not eligible for any of the new positions, and consequently, his claim of age discrimination based on direct evidence failed. With regard to the second plaintiff, the court found that he did not provide any support for the bare allegations that placing a younger employee in a newly created position was direct evidence of age discrimination. While plaintiffs alleged that defendant's agent made discriminatory statements about them, the court found that the agent was only expressing concern that plaintiffs were not keeping with current changes in how a university could best serve its students. Lastly, the court overruled any objections related to indirect evidence and defendant university's legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for reorganization because plaintiffs failed establish how the reorganization decision was not legitimate. Next, the court held that plaintiffs failed provide evidence that defendant's agent made a decision to terminate plaintiffs many weeks prior to the reorganization decision. The court also held that the magistrate properly considered evidence produced at trial when determining that defendant's proposed reasons for termination were not pretexts for age discrimination. Moreover, the court noted that the magistrate properly identified each of the new positions created as a result of the reorganization; noted that one plaintiff interviewed for an open position and was not selected; and the other had the opportunity enter a new position but chose not to. As such, any objections related to pretext were overruled. Lastly, the court found that one plaintiff, with regard to his FMLA retaliation claim, testified that he \"put in for\" FMLA in early May 2012, but there was no other evidence to support his testimony. The court agreed with the magistrate that the plaintiff contacted a representative to request FMLA leave on August 30, 2012, but then failed to subsequently submit a required medical certification. Furthermore, while his request for FMLA leave and official notice of termination were only five days apart, the termination of his position, based on the evidence, was contemplated for at least four months prior. Consequently, any objections with regard to plaintiff's FMLA rights were overruled.",

    "summaries": "Defamation; intentional infliction of emotional distress; negligent supervision and retention. Plaintiff alleged that defendant university's dean of the college of engineering harassed her, obstructed her work, made false statements about her, and subjected her to humiliation, emotional distress, and mental anguish. Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that plaintiff's defamation claim was barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Defendant further asserted that plaintiff failed to state a claim for both intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent hiring and retention. Construing the evidence most strongly in plaintiff's favor, the court found that the dean made statements about plaintiff on February 12, 2012 and she did not file her claim until March 17, 2015. Consequently, any claims about the dean's statements were barred by the one-year statute of limitations. However, the court also found that defendant was not entitled to summary judgment for any statements the dean made about plaintiff after March 17, 2014. Next, the court found that reasonable minds could reach different conclusions as to whether the dean knew or should have known that his actions would result in serious emotional distress to plaintiff, and whether his conduct was extreme and outrageous. Therefore, defendant was not entitled to summary judgment on the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim. Lastly, with regard to plaintiff's claim that defendant negligently hired and retained the dean, the court found that plaintiff did not bring forward facts from which a reasonable factfinder could infer that the dean was not competent. Although his actions could be found unprofessional, obstructionist, and adversarial toward plaintiff, the only reasonable conclusion was that he was competent to be a dean of the college of engineering.",

Plaintiff brought this action for negligence arising out of allegations that, while he was an inmate in the custody and control of defendant, his hand was injured by a corrections officer (CO) and he did not receive timely medical care. The issues of damages and liability were bifurcated. After reviewing the evidence presented at trial, the magistrate adduced that the CO did use force against plaintiff. Next, the magistrate noted that because video evidence did not establish the exact details of what happened, determining the facts required careful consideration and weighing of plaintiff's and the CO's testimony. In that regard, plaintiff offered a more persuasive, direct, and consistent account of what occurred than the CO, whose testimony came across as somewhat evasive or defensive at times. However, plaintiff did not present enough evidence about his claim that defendant failed to provide him with medical treatment until ten days after the incident. Consequently, the magistrate held that plaintiff proved his negligence claim by a preponderance of the evidence as to the CO's use of force, but did not establish any negligence relative to his claim of delayed or untimely medical care.",

Upon review the court found that plaintiff's employment as a professor was governed by a collective bargaining agreement (CBA), the policies of which governed his salary. Plaintiff acknowledged that he knew that the CBA would govern his position as a professor when he resigned from the dean position.

    "summaries": "Breach of contract; unjust enrichment/promissory estoppel; tort claims; breach of fiduciary duty; negligent misrepresentation; fraud; negligence. Plaintiff alleged various claims arising from her enrollment in defendant's Bachelor of Science in Nursing to Doctor of nursing program (BSN-DNP). During this time, the BSN-DNP program was pending accreditation by the national accrediting organization for college nursing programs. Defendant contended that plaintiff's rights as a student in the program were contractual in nature and that the contract did not support any of her claims. The court held that plaintiff failed to prove her breach of contract claim, because she was aware that defendant's BSN-DNP program was not accredited and she did not allege that the terms of defendant's handbook, catalog, or other guideline suggested that the program had been accredited before she enrolled or that it would be accredited before she graduated. Because plaintiff's relationship with defendant was contractual and all of her tort claims arose from the same court of events, she could not sustain those claims. Moreover, the relationship between plaintiff and defendant regarding the accreditation status was purely contractual and no fiduciary relationship existed. Next, plaintiff's unjust enrichment/promissory estoppel and negligent representation claims failed because defendant's agent, even if he made promises or comments to plaintiff that the program would be accredited prior to her graduation, had no authority to do so and plaintiff could not have justifiably relied on those comments. Moreover, her fraud claim failed because she did not offer any proof of fraudulent intent on the part of defendant's agent. Lastly, her negligence claim failed because she could not demonstrate tangible harm to herself though she sought to recover economic loss. In sum, the court found that there were no genuine issues of material fact and granted defendant's motion for summary judgment",
