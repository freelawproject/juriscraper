Plaintiff Taxpayers moved to change the small claims track designation assigned by the Tax Court Management Office for both above-referenced docket numbers, to the standard track to secure more comprehensive discovery. Defendant Township cross-moved for summary judgment to dismiss the added assessment appeal under docket number 008224-2022 as untimely pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:4-63.11. The court denied Defendant's cross-motion to dismiss the added assessment appeal finding that the Township did not establish that the Tax Collector mailed notice of the 2021 added assessment to the Taxpayers, nor did the Taxpayers have constructive notice of the added assessment, and, Taxpayers were further denied a hearing before the Sussex County Board of Taxation. The court granted Plaintiffs' motion the change the track designation in both matters finding that the change is necessary for Plaintiffs to pursue their claims against Defendant. (26 Pages)",

Held: Parties reached a global settlement agreement as to plaintiff's complaint in the Tax Court for tax year 2021 and his petition before the county board of taxation for tax year 2022. The stipulation in the Tax Court matter was silent on the Freeze Act's application. The stipulation in the County Board matter included plaintiff's express waiver of the Freeze Act. Based on the four corners of the Tax Court stipulation, the court found that plaintiff did not waive application of the Freeze Act in the Tax Court matter. Based on the record, the court found that plaintiff's waiver of the Freeze Act in the County Board matter did not extend to, nor would be implied in settlement of the Tax Court matter. The court was unpersuaded that the only base year in a multi-year settlement must be the last year of the value judgment. The court was also unpersuaded that, without more, the County Board's judgment is proof of a change in value for Freeze Act purposes. The court granted plaintiff's motion for application of the Freeze Act to tax year 2023 based on the Tax Court's final value judgment for tax year 2021. (15 Pages)",

HELD: Plaintiff moved to apply the limitations period for assessment of tax to imposition of responsible person liability for gross income tax withholding under N.J.S.A. 54A:9-6(f) and (g) and for sales and use tax under N.J.S.A. 54:32B-2(w). Director opposed and moved to uphold notification of responsible person status issued beyond limitation periods of the Gross Income Tax Act and Sales and Use Tax Act. The court ruled that the notification of responsible person for purposes of imposing the penalty assessed by N.J.S.A. 54A:9-6(f) and/or (g) for gross income tax employer withholding required by N.J.S.A. 54A:7-1 et seq. was subject to the limitations period applicable to assessment of gross income tax. The court ruled that no limitations period applied to the notification of responsible person liability for Sales and Use Tax, as such tax by statute was assessed against the responsible person upon the filing of the return by the seller. 21 pages",

Sullivan (Parker McCay, P.A., attorney); for defendant, Dir., Div. of Taxation - Michael J. Duffy (Matthew J. Platkin, Attorney General of New Jersey, attorney), for remaining defendants and intervenor Strathmore Ins. Co. - Michael A. Guariglia and Jamie Zug (McCarter & English, LLP, attorney). Held: Defendant, Division of Taxation's (\"Taxation\") decision via its web-published Notice in 2016, to extend the statutory cap on premiums applied when computing the insurance premium tax (IPT) for domestic and foreign companies, in calculating the fire insurance premium tax (FIPT) paid to plaintiff by foreign insurers, is contrary to the plain language and intent of the FIPT statute, N.J.S.A 54:18-1, thus is not entitled to any deference. Its interpretation of the provision in N.J.S.A. 54:18A-2(a) that the FIPT is considered \"a part of\" the \"payable\" IPT as requiring the cap to apply in computing the FIPT is unreasonable because, (a) since 1945, this provision has been interpreted to simply mean that the IPT statute requires a credit for the FIPT paid so that a foreign insurer does not pay a tax on fire insurance premiums twice, and (b) it results in plaintiff receiving less than the mandated 2% FIPT on \"all of the\" fire insurance premiums earned in New Jersey. The cap on premiums for purposes of computing the IPT need not, and should not, be extended in computing the FIPT unless the Legislature acts to amend the respective statutes. Due to this holding, the court did not need to consider plaintiff's arguments that Taxation's decision violated the Administrative Procedures Act, or Taxation's arguments that its Notice, as a public guidance document should be upheld under the temporary validity doctrine until it formally promulgates and finalizes regulations reflecting its changed position as to FIPT computation. The court granted NJSFA's motion for partial summary judgment, invalidated the Notice, and denied Taxation's motion for summary judgment.",

Held: Intervenor, Dabby Bergen Medi Pro, LLC, Sianes Bergen Medi Pro, LLC, YB 690 Kinder, LLC, and Yazam Investments, LLC collectively, sought to be joined as a party to the 2021 property tax appeal filed by plaintiff, SF III Kinderkamack, LLC. Intervenor asserted that the court rules pertaining to the transfer of interest, intervention and joinder were applicable; and standing existed to participate in the case as the new owner of the property. Defendant, Borough of Oradell, opposed the motion and maintained that Intervenor did not have standing because it was not the property owner as of the property tax appeal filing deadline, its claim was not within the statute of limitations and the requirements of the applicable court rules were not met. The court determined that Intervenor met the standards to join due to the transfer of interest of the property per the court rules. Moreover, the court found that Intervenor had standing in its fact-sensitive analysis through multiple factors including the review of its financial interest in the property and responsibility to pay taxes. Intervenor was also not barred by the statute of limitations as no new relief was sought. Accordingly, the court granted Intervenor's motion to join the case as a party.",

The court concluded that the subject property's tax assessments should be afforded a presumption of validity because defendant's tax assessor relied on reasonable available market data and methods in fulfilling his constitutional and statutory obligations. The court found that defendant's ineligibility to conduct an annual reassessment program, under N.J.A.C. 18:12A-1.14(i), was not singularly dispositive on the issue of whether the local property tax assessments were entitled to a presumption of validity. Rather, the court observed that the inquiry must focus on whether the valuation and local property tax assessments were reasonably related to sound assessment practices, based on reasonable data and information, a sensitivity to changing market conditions, and consideration of physical factors uniquely applicable to the property. The court found that plaintiff offered no evidence that the market data, analysis, and/or methodology relied upon by the defendant's tax assessor were flawed or arbitrary. Accordingly, the court rejected plaintiff's arguments that no presumption of validity should attach to the subject property's tax assessments.",

The court found that while the Subject Property was within one-half mile of a qualifying rail station, it was not specifically delineated by the NJEDA and thus was ineligible for the exemption under N.J.S.A. 40:55D-8.4(b)(4).

HELD: Plaintiff moved to apply the provisions of the Freeze Act, N.J.S.A. 54:51A-8, for the judgment entered in tax year 2014 to tax years 2015 and 2016. Defendant opposed arguing that the issuance of a permit to develop the subject property under the Coastal Area Facility Review Act, N.J.S.A. 13:19-1 to -51 (\"CAFRA\"), constituted a change in value so that the Freeze Act should not apply. The court ruled that the issuance of a CAFRA permit in and of itself was insufficient to establish a case that an external change in the value of the subject property materialized which \"substantially and meaningfully\" increased the value of the property. Such change can only be demonstrated by showing the value of the property before and after the change. Having failed to make the required prima facie showing, defendant was not entitled to a plenary hearing on the applicability of the Freeze Act.

The court dismissed the untimely 2019 appeal for lack of jurisdiction.

For plaintiffs \u2013 Sylvester Tuohy and Yongjie Tuohy (Self-Represented); for defendant \u2013 Miles Eckardt, Deputy Attorney General (Matthew Platkin, Acting Attorney General of New Jersey, attorney). Held: Defendant's motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of a complaint challenging the assessment of New Jersey gross income tax (\"NJ GIT\") for tax year 2014 is granted. Plaintiffs contend that defendant improperly added back into their gross income the following: (1) dividends, (2) capital gains, and (3) wages withheld to fund a \u00a7 403(b) retirement plan. In addition, plaintiffs argue that defendant erroneously calculated their resident tax credit under N.J.S.A. 54A:4-1 for income subject to tax in other states or political subdivisions. As to the resident tax credit calculation, the court holds plaintiffs are collaterally estopped from relitigating this issue because they unsuccessfully litigated the same issue in the Tax Court for a prior tax year. Even if the principle of collateral estoppel was not applied, plaintiffs' allegations are without merit based on statutory, regulatory, and case law. With regard to plaintiffs' challenge to the addition of dividends, capital gains, and certain wages to their 2014 gross income, the court finds their arguments to be unsupported by statutory or regulatory law, or precedent. Thus, plaintiffs have failed to overcome the presumption of validity accorded to defendant's interpretation of the relevant NJ GIT statutes. Therefore, summary judgment in favor of defendant is appropriate.",

HELD: Plaintiff timely appealed the decision of the County Board of Taxation which dismissed plaintiff's petition pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:4-34 (Chapter 91) for tax year 2021. Defendant moved before this court to dismiss plaintiff's complaint for (a) lack of subject matter jurisdiction; (b) failure to pay taxes pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:51A-1 and (c) failure to respond to a request for income and expense statement pursuant to Chapter 91. The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The court found that plaintiff's prior filing and withdrawal of a direct appeal as to which a judgment of dismissal was entered, did not bar plaintiff from filing an appeal at the County Board of Taxation for the same tax year, or from appealing the resultant decision of the County Board of Taxation to the Tax Court. The court however dismissed the complaint for failure to pay real property taxes as required by N.J.S.A. 54:51A-1(b) since plaintiff failed to produce sufficient proofs of the impact of COVID-19 on its ability to pay the taxes due.

For plaintiff \u2013 Michael J. Caccavelli and Grace Chun (Pearlman & Miranda, LLC, attorneys); for defendant \u2013 Kenneth A. Porro (Chasan Lamparello Mallon & Cappuzzo, P.C., attorneys). The court found that no globally accepted practice has been adopted for the handling of tenant improvement allowances and leasing commission expenses under reconstructed operating statements. For local property tax valuation purposes, the decision to include or exclude tenant improvement allowances and leasing commissions, as stabilized operating expenses, is a function of context, the market, and the intended use of the appraisal report. The characterization of tenant improvement allowances and leasing commissions must be based on the appraiser's examination of a property's historical operations, and evaluation and analysis of market conditions. When tenant improvement allowances and leasing commission expenses are necessary to achieve economic or market rent, stabilize occupancy, and maintain a property's value, they may be treated as operating expenses and deducted from effective gross income in calculating net operating income. However, an appraiser may reject certain expenses, including tenant improvement allowances and leasing commissions, when they are erratic, uncharacteristic, and not typical in the market or industry. Here, the court concluded that plaintiff's expert's approach, deducting tenant improvement allowances and leasing commissions as \"above-the-line\" stabilized operating expenses, was reasonable and supported by the trial record. The court further concluded that the Band of Investment technique provided the most accurate and reliable method of deriving a capitalization rate because it is not polluted or impacted by questions of how potential survey recipients perceived hypothetical transactional questions or how a market perceives an annually reoccurring operating expense. Finally, in reducing the property's 2014 and 2015 tax assessments, the court found that the subject property's 2019 sale was not credible evidence of true or fair market value. The court scheduled the 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 tax year matters for further proceedings.",

Bick (Giordiano Halleran Ciesla PC, attorneys); for defendants - Joseph Palumbo, Anthony D. Tancini (Andrew J. Bruck, Acting Attorney General of New Jersey, attorney); Harold H. Hensel (Secare & Hensel, attorneys). Held: Plaintiff's contention that the Non-Residential Development Fee (NRDF) imposed under N.J.S.A. 40:55D-8.4 should be computed by attributing $0 to equalized assessed value of the improvements because they are exempt from local property tax under the Long - Term Tax Exemption law, N.J.S.A. 40A:20-1 to -22, is rejected based on the plain language of the NRDF statute. The amount to be excluded for the parking lot when computing the NRDF is its value as determined under the accepted methods employed for valuing all real property in the local property tax arena (cost, income, comparable sales). The court's standard of review of the assessor's value determination of the parking lot for purposes of its exclusion when computing the NRDF, is the same as in local property tax matters. Thus, a presumptive correctness attaches to the assessor's determination with the burden of proof upon the property owner to overcome the same and persuade the court that the exclusion amount should be different. Here, based on the evidence provided, plaintiff failed to persuade the court that the value of the parking lot to be excluded for purposes of calculating the NRDF should be $3,407,000. The court therefore affirms the final determination of defendant, Director, Division of Taxation, that the assessor of defendant, Township of Lakewood, correctly determined the NRDF.",

For plaintiff \u2013 Daniel G. Keough (Ventura, Miesowitz, Keough & Warner, PC, attorney); for defendant \u2013 Jarrid H. Kantor (Antonelli Kantor, PC, attorney). Held: Defendant's motions to dismiss plaintiffs' complaints under N.J.S.A. 54:51A-1(b), which requires a taxpayer to satisfy certain local property tax obligations prior to filing an action in the Tax Court, are granted. While the requirement was previously jurisdictional, allowing the court no discretion in determining if a matter should proceed, the statute was amended in 1999 to provide for relaxation of the tax payment provision in the interests of justice. Plaintiff New West, owner of the 15 properties during tax years 2013 through 2015, offers no reason for relaxation. Plaintiff Crown, owner of the properties for tax year 2016, contends its difficulty in ascertaining arrearages owed for all tax years warrants relaxation of the tax payment requirement. The court rejects plaintiff's argument, holding that the interests of justice would be subverted by allowing the complaints to go forward under the circumstances. In addition, plaintiffs argue that defendant's failure to object to the non-payment of property taxes when these matters were before the county tax board bars it from raising the same objection in Tax Court. The court holds that while the county tax boards and Tax Court are governed by tax payment provisions under N.J.S.A. 54:3-27 and N.J.S.A. 54:51A-1(b) respectively, they are separate and distinct, and contain different payment schemes. Thus, the court concludes defendant is not barred from raising the objection in Tax Court.",

For plaintiffs - Punish and Indu Malhotra (Self-represented); for defendant - Miles Eckardt, Deputy Attorney General (Andrew J. Bruck, Acting Attorney General of New Jersey, attorney). Plaintiffs sought relief from penalties and interest after being assessed for an erroneous income tax refund due to an error on their tax return for New Jersey income tax withholding. Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment seeking recovery of the erroneous refund with applicable penalties and interest. Plaintiffs filed a cross motion for summary judgment requesting that penalties and interest be abated due to the lengthy passage of time for assessment. The court first determined whether defendant had statutory authority to recover the erroneous refund pursuant to the applicable statute of limitations. Defendant argued that the statute of limitations to obtain the erroneous refund was either three years from the date the tax return was due or an extended five-year statute of limitations due to a misrepresentation of material fact on the tax return. Plaintiff argued that the mistake on the tax return does not qualify as a misrepresentation. The court found that the three-year statute of limitations expired three years from the making of the refund and the five-year statute of limitations did not apply because plaintiffs' mistake did not rise to the level of a misrepresentation. Accordingly, the court denied defendant's motion for summary judgment to recover the erroneous refund. Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment was granted to abate the penalties and interest as there was no tax due and any payments made, or tax refunds withheld, were to be returned with applicable interest.",

Setzer on the brief); for defendant \u2013 Joseph A. Palumbo, Deputy Attorney General (Andrew J. Bruck, Acting Attorney General of New Jersey, attorney). The Clean Communities and Recycling Grant Act imposes a user fee, commonly referred to as the litter tax. The fee is based upon the sales of litter-generating products by manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers. Wholesaler-to-wholesaler sales are exempt. While plaintiff admits it manufactures the products at issue, it also asserts the wholesaler-to-wholesaler exemption applies for sales it makes to wholesalers. The court noted that under plaintiff's argument, all manufacturers that sell to wholesalers would claim the exemption thus rendering the statutory reference to manufacturer sales superfluous. In addition, the court held that the plain language of the Act provides that the fee is based upon sales within the state, not whether the manufacturing occurred in-state. Moreover, the Legislature did not intend to put local manufacturers at a disadvantage. Finally, the longstanding regulations adopted by the Director provide that the location of where the manufacturing takes place is not determinative.",

For plaintiff \u2013 Jeffrey D. Gordon (Archer & Greiner, PC, attorney), for defendant \u2013 Fred Semrau and Robert J. Rossmeissl (Dorsey & Semrau, LLC, attorney). Plaintiff, Ian Kunesch (\"Mr. Kunesch\"), timely filed local property tax appeals with this court for tax years 2013-2019, challenging the assessments imposed by defendant (\"Township\") on certain real property (\"Property\") located in the Township. The Township moved to dismiss those complaints on grounds Mr. Kunesch is not an aggrieved taxpayer within the meaning of N.J.S.A. 54:3- 21, given that he executed a deed in lieu of foreclosure to the lending bank, which stripped him of standing to bring his tax appeals. The court determined that the Township's motions were without merit, and that Mr. Kunesch has standing to proceed. The court concluded that the lending bank and Mr. Kunesch intended for Mr. Kunesch to remain the owner and in possession of the Property unless he defaulted, at which point the second of two Deeds in Lieu of Foreclosure executed would be recorded. Furthermore, the court found that the second Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure is more appropriately characterized as an equitable mortgage because it was in essence security for a loan. Finally, the court rejected the Township's argument that Mr. Kunesch was judicially estopped from bringing these tax appeals by finding no miscarriage of justice in proceeding with these matters.",

Reviewing the legislative history as well as the wording of the amendments to the exemption statute over the years, the court held that the Legislature did not intend to incorporate the definition of autobus found in Title 48 into Title 54. As a result, the taxpayer qualifies for the exemption.",
