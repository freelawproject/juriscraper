    "summaries": "\u00b6 0 Medical providers sued a former employee for breach of an employment agreement. Employee filed counterclaims alleging he was owed unpaid wages and bonuses. Providers filed an answer to the counterclaims, raising \"failure to state a claim\" as the sole affirmative defense. After nearly four-years of litigation, providers attempted to raise, for the first time, that the contract was illegal and therefore void as a matter of law. The lower court issued an order finding providers had waived the affirmative defense, thus precluding its use as shield from liability. Following a trial on the merits, the trial judge determined providers had breached the employment agreement and issued a money judgment of $387,618.36 in favor of employee. Providers appealed and the Court of Civil Appeals reversed, concluding that refusal to consider providers' claim of illegality was an abuse of discretion. We granted certiorari and now hold the trial judge did not abuse her discretion in striking the Plaintiffs/Appellants' last-minute effort to raise a new affirmative defense.",

After Kerr fired them, the plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against him. Kerr sought to compel arbitration pursuant to arbitration provisions of the plaintiffs' employment contracts. The plaintiffs objected, arguing that they could not be compelled to arbitrate because federal and state law precluded arbitration. The trial court disagreed, granted the motion to compel arbitration, and stayed the lawsuit until completion of arbitration. The plaintiffs appealed, and the Court of Civil Appeals affirmed. We granted certiorari and hold that: 1) employees who deliver Amazon packages are exempted from arbitration under federal law; and 2) the district court's exclusive jurisdiction over the retaliatory discharge claims precludes arbitration of those claims under Oklahoma law. STAY OF NOVEMBER 20, 2023, LIFTED; COURT OF CIVIL APPEALS OPINION VACATED; TRIAL COURT REVERSED AND REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS OPINION.",
