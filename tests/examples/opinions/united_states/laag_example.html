        A determination of whether certain employees are considered "eligible workers" is left to the public entity that will be expending ARPA funds for the purpose of granting retroactive premium pay. The use of ARPA funds for retroactive premium pay or otherwise is discretionary for the entity that has received ARPA funds and the determination of the use or the extent of the use of ARPA funds is left to the entity expending such funds.  Retroactive premium pay may not be paid using CARES Act funds, however, a public entity may, in some instances, grant retroactive hazard pay using CARES Act funds.  We note that the U.S. Department of Treasury will be the ultimate arbiter of whether a local government has used ARPA funds and/or CARES Act funds properly. <br>
