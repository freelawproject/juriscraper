    "summaries": "In this appeal, we examine the privilege provided under Tennessee Code Annotated section 68-11-272, commonly referred to as the quality improvement committee or \"QIC\" privilege, and its application. Plaintiff filed this healthcare liability action asserting that CHI Memorial Hospital and other entities and physicians were negligent in providing care for her husband, who passed away shortly after being discharged from the hospital's emergency room. Defendants sought a protective order based on the QIC privilege to prohibit inquiry into a meeting held by the hospital and the decedent's family. The trial court denied Defendants' motion. On interlocutory review, the Court of Appeals affirmed, finding that statements made in the meeting were not protected by the QIC privilege. Defendants appealed, arguing that the information sought related to QIC activities and therefore was privileged from direct or indirect discovery. We hold the QIC privilege applied to statements made during the meeting that were based on information obtained during the QIC process, but Memorial waived the privilege when hospital management voluntarily disclosed that privileged information.",

    "summaries": "A court-approved marital dissolution agreement awarded Vanessa Turner alimony. Her former husband, John Colley, later sought to modify the alimony award but voluntarily dismissed that post-judgment action without prejudice before it was adjudicated. The question here is whether Ms. Turner is the \"prevailing party\" in the post-judgment proceeding and therefore entitled to attorney's fees under the parties' marital dissolution agreement and Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-5-103(c). The majority opinion concludes that she is. I agree with that bottom line but not with the entirety of the majority's legal analysis. The majority reasons that Ms. Turner prevailed in the post-judgment proceeding because her objective was to maintain the status quo, and she achieved that objective when her former husband voluntarily dismissed his petition. In my view, a voluntary dismissal without prejudice\u2014standing alone\u2014could not make Ms. Turner a prevailing party. Although Ms. Turner may have \"prevailed\" in the colloquial sense of that term when the petition was voluntary dismissed, she was a \"prevailing party\" as that legal term of art has long been understood only because the voluntary dismissal meant that she had succeeded in defending earlier court-awarded relief. To the extent the majority opinion holds that a defendant can be a prevailing party in the absence of any judicially sanctioned change in the parties' legal relationship or judicial rejection of the plaintiff's claims, I disagree. I write separately to explain my position.",

    "summaries": "In this case, we construe the parties' marital dissolution agreement, as well as Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-5-103(c), which permits attorney fee awards in certain original and post-award proceedings in family law cases involving alimony, child support, child custody, and permanent parenting plans. Here, the former husband filed a post-divorce petition to alter the award of transitional alimony, and after considerable litigation, he nonsuited it. The question on appeal under both the marital dissolution agreement and the statute is whether a trial court may award attorney fees to a former spouse for fees incurred in defending the original award of alimony in post-divorce proceedings, where the petition to modify the award was nonsuited before adjudication on the merits. We hold that it may. Under the marital dissolution agreement, our holding is based on the language of the parties' agreement. As to the statute, Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-5-103(c) explicitly applies in post-award proceedings to \"enforce, alter, change, or modify\" an existing decree of alimony, child support, custody, or a permanent parenting plan. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-5-103(c). For an obligee spouse defending against an obligor spouse's effort to reduce or end alimony or child support, or modify a permanent parenting plan, the objective may be to maintain the status quo. This objective is achieved upon voluntary dismissal by the obligor spouse. Under these circumstances, the obligee spouse is a \"prevailing party\" under section 36-5-103(c). For this reason, we hold that trial courts may award attorney fees to an obligee spouse under the statute after the obligor spouse nonsuits a post-divorce petition. Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals, affirm the trial court's award of attorney fees to the former wife, award the former wife attorney fees on appeal, and remand the case to the trial court for a determination of the amount of reasonable attorney fees.",

    "summaries": "We granted review in this case to decide whether our collateral estoppel doctrine bars relitigation of a prior class certification denial which was affirmed on appeal. In 2014, Plaintiff Emergency Medical Care Facilities, P.C. filed a putative class action against Defendant BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee, Inc. EMCF alleged that BCBST had breached various contracts with it and other similar entities by applying a cap on certain payments for medical services after an action by TennCare. The trial court denied class certification, and the Court of Appeals affirmed and remanded. EMCF subsequently voluntarily nonsuited its claims. After getting a favorable ruling in a separate lawsuit against TennCare, EMCF refiled its case against BCBST, again seeking class certification. The trial court held that collateral estoppel precluded relitigation of class certification, but the Court of Appeals reversed. We hold that the trial court got it right. In this case, the same plaintiff filed suit against the same defendant for the same claims on behalf of the same putative class based on the same common questions. Our collateral estoppel doctrine exists to prevent this type of second-chance relitigation. Certain decisions are final and binding, including when a trial court and appellate court conclude that a particular class cannot be certified. The plaintiff here is certainly entitled to have the merits of its substantive claims heard in its refiled action, but it does not get a do-over on class certification.",

    "summaries": "In this appeal regarding Tennessee's survival statute, Tennessee Code Annotated section 20-5-102, we hold that a cause of action for invasion of privacy based on intrusion upon seclusion does not abate upon the death of the person whose privacy was invaded. Here, an elderly woman with severely impaired cognitive functioning was a resident of the defendant skilled nursing facility. While an employee of the facility was helping the resident take a shower, the employee took a personal video call with her incarcerated boyfriend. During the call, the employee propped her cell phone in the shower in a way that displayed the resident's nude body to the boyfriend. The resident's conservator sued the defendant facility claiming, inter alia, invasion of the resident's privacy. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the facility, and the plaintiff appealed. While the appeal was pending, the resident died, and her estate was substituted. The Court of Appeals reversed; it held the complaint stated a claim for invasion of privacy based on intrusion upon seclusion, and that the claim did not abate upon the death of the resident. We granted the defendant facility permission to appeal on abatement. Tennessee Code Annotated section 20-5-102 provides that no civil action based on \"wrongs\" abates upon the death of either party, \"except actions for wrongs affecting the character of the plaintiff.\" On appeal, the defendant facility argues that the claim abated either because section 20-5-102 does not apply at all, or because the character exception in the statute applies, since a claim for intrusion upon seclusion is an action for \"wrongs affecting the character of the plaintiff.\" We hold that the survival statute, section 20-5-102, applies to the claim of intrusion upon seclusion, and that the exception for actions for \"wrongs affecting the character of the plaintiff\" does not apply. Therefore, we affirm the holding of the Court of Appeals that the claim for intrusion upon seclusion did not abate upon the death of the resident whose privacy was invaded.",

    "summaries": "In this appeal, we hold that the right to petition in the Tennessee Constitution is enforceable against governmental entities, not private parties, and that it cannot be the basis for a \"public policy\" exception to the employment-at-will doctrine as against private employers. Here, the plaintiff at-will employee emailed members of the Tennessee General Assembly expressing grievances about the COVID-19 vaccination mandate implemented by her employer, a private organization. After the employer told the plaintiff that the email violated the employer's policies, the employee sent a second similar email to legislators. The defendant terminated the plaintiff's employment. The plaintiff sued the defendant private employer for retaliatory discharge, asserting her employment was terminated for exercising the right to petition in Article I, Section 23 of the Tennessee Constitution. The trial court dismissed the complaint, and the Court of Appeals reversed. On appeal, our review shows that, for hundreds of years dating back to early England, the constitutional right to petition has been considered a bulwark against government oppression, not a constraint on private parties. No state in the nation has held that the right to petition applies to limit the ability of private employers to terminate the employment of at-will employees, and the language in Article I, Section 23 does not mandate such a holding. We hold that Article I, Section 23 is enforceable only against the government, not against private actors; consequently, private employers do not violate a clear public policy by terminating employees for exercising the right to petition. Thus, at-will employees may not base claims of retaliatory discharge against private employers on the right to petition in the Tennessee Constitution. Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals and affirm the trial court's dismissal of the plaintiff's complaint.",

Article VI, Section 4 of the Tennessee Constitution requires inferior court judges to be \"elected by the qualified voters of the district or circuit to which they are to be assigned [and] have been a resident . . . of the circuit or district one year\" prior to election. Tenn. Const. art. VI, \u00a7 4. The appellant, Robin McNabb, proceeding pro se, filed an election contest against the appellee, Gregory Harrison, contending that he was constitutionally ineligible to be elected as Lenoir City Municipal Judge. Ms. McNabb asserted that \"district\" in Article VI, Section 4 refers to Lenoir City, and that Mr. Harrison had not lived within city limits in the year preceding. The trial court found that \"district\" as used in Article VI, Section 4 refers to the modern-day judicial district. Because Mr. Harrison resided in the Ninth Judicial District, the trial court found him to be eligible to serve as Lenoir City Municipal Judge. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court, but modified the trial court's judgment, finding that Article VI, Section 4 required Mr. Harrison to be a resident of Loudon County, rather than the Ninth Judicial District. McNabb v. Harrison, No. E2022-01557-COA-R3-CV, 2023 WL 7019872, at 8 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 25, 2023), perm. app. granted, (Tenn. Apr. 11, 2024). The Court of Appeals reasoned that because the Lenoir City Municipal Court has concurrent jurisdiction with the Loudon County General Sessions Court, \"district\" as used in Article VI, Section 4 means Loudon County. Id. We respectfully disagree. We hold that Article VI, Section 4 requires a candidate running for a municipal judgeship to be a resident of the same municipality to which they will be assigned. Therefore, Article VI, Section 4 of the Tennessee Constitution required Mr. Harrison to reside in Lenoir City. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand to the Chancery Court for Loudon County.",

While riding his motorcycle, Rimmel aggressively pursued Burke on the interstate and eventually broke the passenger window of Burke's car by pounding on it with the slide of a loaded handgun. Rimmel never fired the handgun or pointed it in Burke's direction, however, and Burke was unaware that the object used to break the window was a gun. A jury convicted Rimmel of attempted aggravated assault and felony reckless endangerment with a handgun. Rimmel challenges the sufficiency of the evidence for both convictions. Because we conclude that Rimmel intended to place Burke in reasonable fear of serious bodily injury by using his handgun and took a substantial step toward doing so, we affirm his conviction for attempted aggravated assault. But because the evidence does not establish that Rimmel's handgun-related conduct placed Burke in imminent danger of serious bodily injury or death, we reverse his conviction for felony reckless endangerment.",

When the two entities did not answer, he was awarded a default judgment. The entities moved to vacate the default judgment before it became final. They argued that the trial court should not have entered judgment in the first place because the complaint did not plead the elements required for piercing the corporate veil. They also argued that their failure to respond was due to excusable neglect, but they later withdrew that argument. The trial court denied the motion to vacate. In determining that the complaint stated a claim for piercing the corporate veil, the trial court evaluated the factual allegations under the so-called Allen factors. See Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Allen, 584 F. Supp. 386 (E.D. Tenn. 1984). On appeal as of right, the Court of Appeals reversed. The court looked not to the Allen factors, but rather to a three-element standard set forth in Continental Bankers Life Insurance Co. of the South v. Bank of Alamo, 578 S.W.2d 625 (Tenn. 1979). We granted permission to appeal. Based on our review of the applicable law, we hold that it was proper in this case to address whether the complaint pleaded the elements for piercing the corporate veil even absent a claim of excusable neglect. We further hold that the Continental Bankers elements provide the correct framework for piercing the corporate veil and that the complaint failed to plead the elements sufficiently. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals that the trial court erred in denying the motion to vacate the default judgment. We remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.",

    "summaries": "Christopher Oberton Curry, Jr. (\"Defendant\") sought this Court's review of his 2022conviction for unlawful possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a felonycrime of violence. Pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated section 39-17-1307, unlawfulpossession of a firearm by a convicted felon is a Class E felony; however, if the priorconviction is for a felony crime of violence, the punishment is increased to a Class B felony.At Defendant's trial in the present case, the State introduced a certified judgment ofconviction for Defendant's 2017 conviction for robbery, and the trial judge instructed thejury that robbery is a crime of violence. Robbery, however, is not included in the statutorydefinition of crimes of violence set forth in Tennessee Code Annotated section 39-17-1301(3). Defendant was convicted and received an effective ten-year sentence. On appeal,Defendant argues, among other things, that the evidence was insufficient to support hisconviction because the State failed to establish that the predicate felony of robbery was acrime of violence. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, concluding that robbery is acrime of violence despite its absence from the statutory definition of the term. We grantedDefendant's application for permission to appeal to consider whether robbery isencompassed within the statutory definition of \"crime of violence\" and to determinewhether the evidence at trial was sufficient to support Defendant's conviction. Afterreview, we agree with the lower courts that robbery can be a \"crime of violence\" within thedefinition contained in section 39-17-1301(3). However, we conclude that whether robberyis a \"crime of violence\" in a particular unlawful possession of a firearm case is a questionfor a properly instructed jury, not the trial judge. Because the State did not present sufficientevidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that Defendant's prior robbery wasa crime of violence, we reverse, in part, the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals andvacate the judgment of the trial court on Count 1. The case is remanded to the trial courtfor entry of a new judgment reducing the conviction in Count 1 to a Class E felony and forfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.",

That refrain has been part of Tennessee's tort law for nearly a century. See, e.g., Ill. Cent. R.R. v. Nichols, 118 S.W.2d 213, 217 (Tenn. 1938). Accordingly, to impose a duty on a premises owner to remedy or warn against unsafe conditions created by others, a plaintiff must establish that the premises owner had actual or constructive knowledge of the unsafe condition. Until today, constructive knowledge required proof either that (1) the unsafe condition had existed long enough for a reasonable premises owner to discover it, or (2) a similar condition had occurred in the past, making it reasonably foreseeable that it would occur again. See Blair, 130 S.W.3d at 765\u201366. The majority opinion creates a third category that has no footing in our existing precedents. It holds that premises owners also owe entrants a duty to protect against an unsafe condition on the property when it is \"reasonably foreseeable that an unsafe condition [will] arise\" on the premises \"without proper maintenance.\" The majority's holding is contrary to Blair and other binding precedents, creates confusion for premises owners and lower courts, and exposes premises owners to expansive new liability. I respectfully dissent.",

    "summaries": "This appeal arises from a slip-and-fall incident at an apartment complex in Franklin, Tennessee. On a rainy morning at the Venue at Cool Springs apartment complex, owned and operated by Mid-America Apartments, LP, Robert Trentham slipped and fell on a pedestrian bridge on the way back to his apartment. Mr. Trentham sustained serious injuries and filed a premises-liability lawsuit alleging that MAA had been negligent in maintaining the pedestrian bridge. Mr. Trentham asserted that his slip-and-fall was caused by a microbial growth on the bridge that MAA should have known about and should have addressed. The trial court found in favor of Mr. Trentham, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the trial court. MAA disputes the holding of the lower courts that it was on constructive notice of a dangerous condition on the pedestrian bridge. We hold that, because the microbial growth on the pedestrian bridge amounts to a \"general or continuing condition indicating the dangerous condition's existence,\" Blair v. W. Town Mall, 130 S.W.3d 761, 762 (Tenn. 2004), MAA was on constructive notice of a dangerous condition on the bridge at the time of Mr. Trentham's fall. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.",

    "summaries": "Plaintiff Terry Case did not make his mortgage payments for several years. The real property which secured his loan was subsequently sold at a foreclosure sale following the postponement of a prior sale date. Mr. Case brought a claim for \"wrongful foreclosure,\" among others, alleging Defendants Wilmington Trust, N.A. and Wilson & Associates, PLLC violated the notice requirements in the applicable deed of trust by failing to provide him with written notice of the postponement. The trial court granted summary judgment to Defendants, and Mr. Case solely appealed the dismissal of his claim for \"wrongful foreclosure.\" The Court of Appeals reversed, finding that Defendants failed to satisfy their notice obligations under the deed of trust and that summary judgment on the claim for \"wrongful foreclosure\" was therefore inappropriate. Defendant Wilmington Trust applied for permission to appeal to this Court, and we granted review to determine (1) whether Tennessee recognizes a common law cause of action for \"wrongful foreclosure,\" and (2) whether the Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac Uniform Deed of Trust requires written notice of postponement in addition to oral announcement pursuant to section 35-5-101(f) of the Tennessee Code. We further instructed the parties to address whether Mr. Case satisfied the requirements for constitutional standing. We hold that Mr. Case has constitutional standing to bring his claim. However, we also hold that there is no common law cause of action for \"wrongful foreclosure\" in Tennessee. As a result, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand to the trial court for entry of an order consistent with this opinion.",

    "summaries": "In this appeal, we examine the intersection of the rule governing the voluntary dismissal of a civil action, Tenn. R. Civ. P. 41.01, and the statutory scheme of the Tennessee Public Participation Act (\"TPPA\"), Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 20-17-101 to -110 (2021). Robert E. Lee Flade filed suit against several defendants over what he considered to be disparaging remarks that were made on social media. Two of the defendants, Stephanie Isaacs and the Bedford County Listening Project (\"the BCLP\"), each filed not only a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rule 12.02(6) of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure, but also a petition to dismiss pursuant to the TPPA. The TPPA petitions sought dismissal of the complaint with prejudice, an award of attorney's fees and costs, and an award of sanctions. Mr. Flade filed responses, and both the motions and the petitions were set for hearing. However, before the trial court conducted the hearing, Mr. Flade voluntarily nonsuited his complaint. As a result, the trial court entered an order of dismissal without prejudice. Ms. Isaacs and the BCLP sought to have the trial court adjudicate their TPPA petitions notwithstanding the dismissal of the complaint. The trial court determined that Mr. Flade's nonsuit concluded the matter and declined to adjudicate the TPPA petitions. On appeal as of right, the Court of Appeals affirmed. Flade v. City of Shelbyville, No. M2022-00553-COA-R3-CV, 2023 WL 2200729, at 1 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 24, 2023), perm. app. granted, (Tenn. Aug. 9, 2023). We granted permission to appeal. Based on our review of applicable law, we conclude that although the right to take a voluntary nonsuit is subject to certain limitations, the mere filing of a TPPA petition is not among them. Thus, we hold that the trial court correctly declined to adjudicate the pending TPPA petitions after Mr. Flade voluntarily nonsuited his complaint. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.",

    "summaries": "This appeal presents the issue of how the legalization of hemp affects a probable cause analysis where law enforcement relied, in part, on a positive alert from a drug-sniffing canine incapable of differentiating between the smell of legal hemp and illegal marijuana. After initiating a routine traffic stop, law enforcement conducted an open-air sniff using a drug-sniffing canine. Based on the canine's positive alert on the vehicle, combined with other facts observed by the officer, law enforcement searched the vehicle without a warrant pursuant to the automobile exception to the warrant requirement. The search revealed the following items inside a backpack: one ounce of marijuana, a loaded handgun, Ziploc bags, and a scale. The defendant, a passenger in the vehicle, was indicted for possession of marijuana with intent to manufacture, sell, or deliver; possession of a firearm with intent to go armed during the commission of a dangerous felony; and possession of drug paraphernalia. The defendant filed a motion to suppress, arguing that the canine sweep could not provide probable cause because the canine could not distinguish between the smell of legalized hemp and illegal marijuana. The trial court granted the motion to suppress and dismissed the charges against the defendant. The Court of Criminal Appeals reversed by holding that the smell of illegal marijuana provides law enforcement with probable cause to search a vehicle. Alternatively, the intermediate court held that law enforcement possessed probable cause based on the totality of the circumstances. The defendant appealed to this Court, and we granted review. First, we clarify that State v. England, 19 S.W.3d 762 (Tenn. 2000), does not provide a per se rule of probable cause based on a positive indication from a drug-sniffing dog. Rather, England provides for an examination of the totality of the circumstances. Second, we hold that a positive indication from a drug-sniffing canine may continue to contribute to a finding of probable cause when examining the totality of the circumstances, notwithstanding the legalization of hemp. After examining the totality of the circumstances in this case, we conclude that law enforcement possessed probable cause to search the vehicle. As a result, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals reinstating the indictments against the defendant and remanding for further proceedings.",
