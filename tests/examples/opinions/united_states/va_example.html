<p><a name="1210389_20231019"></a><a href="opinions/opnscvwp/1210389.pdf"> 210389</a> <b>McKeithen v. City of Richmond</b>  10/19/2023
In an as-applied challenge to the constitutionality of the escheat provision of Code § 58.1-3967, where a city obtained a judicial sale of a parcel of property subject to a statutory lien for delinquent taxes and the sale proceeds wholly satisfied the city?s tax lien, the holding of the circuit court that the statute required it to award a portion of the surplus sale proceeds to the city rather than an unsatisfied junior lienor, while required by the text of the escheat provision, nevertheless violates Article I, Section 11 of the Constitution of Virginia concerning the taking of private property. The circuit court erred in failing to so rule, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

Considering defendant?s appeal from his convictions on multiple counts of aggravated sexual battery by a parent under Code § 18.2-67.3 and taking indecent liberties with a child under Code § 18.2-370.1, in which he argued that the circuit court erred in determining that the proffered testimony of a witness indicating that the defendant remained outside of the witness? home with her for several hours instead of accompanying his two minor daughters inside to sleep constituted inadmissible alibi testimony not timely disclosed pursuant to Rule 3A:11(d)(2), the Court of Appeals erred in addressing the merits of defendant?s argument where the defendant?s assignment of error indicated that the proffered testimony was not evidence of an alibi because it was instead offered to impeach by contradiction the testimony of his daughters, who were the victims. However, defendant never argued at trial that the proffered testimony was offered for impeachment purposes; rather, he only argued that it was not alibi evidence. As a result, defendant?s argument was waived. That portion of the Court of Appeals? judgment is reversed, but judgment upholding the conviction is affirmed.

In an appeal by the Commonwealth from a decision by the Court of Appeals of Virginia, it is held that Rule 3A:15 does not preclude the circuit court from reconsidering a motion to strike that was erroneously granted in a criminal case. While the Double Jeopardy Clause imposes some restrictions on a trial court?s authority to reconsider a motion to strike, those limitations do not apply here. Consequently, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and final judgment is entered on this appeal in favor of the Commonwealth.

On a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, asserting that the Virginia Department of Corrections (?VDOC?) failed to timely release the petitioner from prison because it undercalculated his earned sentence credits (?ESCs?), pursuant to amendments to Code § 53.1-202.3 adopted by the General Assembly in 2020, the judgment of the circuit court concluding that he was not entitled to immediate release is affirmed.

In a shareholder-derivative suit by the minority shareholder of a closely held Virginia corporation against his wife, the majority shareholder, in which the trial court rejected the derivative claim and imposed sanctions for pursuing it, the plaintiff had standing to appeal the sanctions award entered against him personally as the ?plaintiff? under Code § 13.1-672.5. Because the sanctions order violated Rule 1:1, the May 12, 2021 Final Order was the final order in this case, and the order granting sanctions three months later is vacated.

On a state prisoner?s petition for a writ of habeas corpus, contending that he was wrongfully denied earned sentence credits on his convictions for attempted aggravated murder that, if awarded, would result in his immediate release from incarceration, the petition is granted. By its plain language, Code § 53.1-202.3 establishes that all inmates are eligible for expanded earned sentence credits unless they were convicted of an offense that is enumerated under subsection A, and here the petitioner was convicted of attempted aggravated murder, which is not one of the enumerated offenses that is ineligible for expanded earned sentence credits under subsection A. Nor is attempted aggravated murder one of the other specifically enumerated offenses ineligible for expanded earned sentence credits under the statute. Thus, there is no basis in the governing statutes for denying the petitioner expanded earned sentence credits on his attempted aggravated murder convictions. The petition is granted, and a writ of habeas corpus is issued to the Director of the Virginia Department of Corrections ordering that this prisoner be released from custody.

The defendant left her 80-year-old mother in a squalid condition lying on the floor of her apartment for at least two days, resulting in her mother?s need for emergency medical care and hospitalization. The trial court convicted defendant of abuse or neglect of an incapacitated adult causing injury in violation of Code § 18.2-369(B). The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, as does this Court.

<p><a name="1210988_20230608"></a><a href="opinions/opnscvwp/1210988.pdf"> 210988</a> <b>City of Hampton v. Williamson</b>  06/08/2023
In a city?s appeal from a circuit court decision to grant a petition for a writ of mandamus, requiring production of certain documents ancillary to a grievance panel hearing, having provided the grievant with its list of witnesses and a binder with the documents furnished to the grievance panel, the city has clearly met its obligation under Code §15.2-1507(A)(10)(b)(3) and, regardless of whether the city intends to use the documents in the grievance binder, as it originally suggested, or to rely solely on witness testimony, a writ of mandamus does not lie here. The circuit court?s judgment is reversed, and the petition for a writ of mandamus is dismissed.

<p><a name="1220378_20230601"></a><a href="opinions/opnscvwp/1220378.pdf"> 220378</a> <b>Walker v. Commonwealth</b>  06/01/2023
In an appeal from a conviction for bank robbery and use of a firearm in commission of robbery, second or subsequent offense under the provisions of Code § 18.2-53.1, the convictions are affirmed. The argument that the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution requires a court to pre-screen eyewitness identification testimony before the eyewitness can be permitted to make an identification of the defendant for the first time in open court is rejected. In addition, the jury was properly instructed that the defendant was subject to the second or subsequent offense provisions of Code § 18.2-53.1 for using a firearm in the commission of robbery. The convictions are affirmed.
</p>

<p><a name="1210779_20230518"></a><a href="opinions/opnscvwp/1210779.pdf"> 210779</a> <b>Gloss v. Wheeler</b>  05/18/2023
In a petition for mandamus and injunctive relief brought by two residents of a county alleging a violation of the Virginia Freedom of Information Act (?VFOIA?), the circuit court erred in granting a motion to strike by the defendant Board of Supervisors (?Board?) members on the theory that the gathering at issue ? a meeting of the police department?s Citizens Advisory Board ? did not constitute a meeting under VFOIA. The judgment of the circuit court is reversed, and this matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

<p><a name="1220072_20230504"></a><a href="opinions/opnscvwp/1220072.pdf"> 220072</a> <b>Oreze Healthcare v. Eastern Shore Community Svcs Board</b>  05/04/2023
In a breach of contract claim relating to a lease of real property, the circuit court erred in holding that the plaintiff?s conveyance of the real property to a third party prohibited it from pursuing a breach of contract claim against the defendant based upon a prior lease agreement for that property between the parties. Plaintiff?s sale of the property to a third party after the lease was terminated did not transfer that claim to the third party as successor in interest simply by execution of the deed. While plaintiff could have assigned its right to the breach of contract claim to the third party, here the deed conveying the property was silent as to that claim and ? absent an assignment ? the deed could neither extinguish plaintiff?s right to pursue the claim nor transfer the claim to the third party. For the reasons set forth in the present opinion, the circuit court?s judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.
</p>

<p><a name="1220643_20230504"></a><a href="opinions/opnscvwp/1220643.pdf"> 220643</a> <b>Brown v. Virginia State Bar</b>  05/04/2023
In an appeal of right from an attorney disciplinary proceeding before a three judge panel, the circuit court?s finding that this lawyer violated Rule 1.7(a)(2) by engaging in sexual relations with his divorce client during the representation is supported by the record, and the finding that he added a fault ground for divorce against his client, as well as other findings of fact with which the lawyer takes issue, are likewise supported by the record. Additionally, the Virginia State Bar, in its assignment of cross-error, merely asked for a reversal and final judgment as to the claimed Rule 2.1 violation, with the previously issued public reprimand on another proven violation extended to encompass the Rule 2.1 violation in the event of a reversal. However, an affirmative finding of a Rule 2.1 violation would require a remand and further sanctions proceeding, which was not requested. Therefore, given that the Bar did not ask for a rules-required remand in the event of a reversal, the Court does not consider the Bar?s assignment of cross-error. As a result, the circuit court?s decision is affirmed.

<p><a name="1220116_20230427"></a><a href="opinions/opnscvwp/1220116.pdf"> 220116</a> <b>Suffolk City School Board v. Wahlstrom</b>  04/27/2023
In the plaintiff?s action alleging that a city School Board and two school officials violated the Virginia Freedom of Information Act (?VFOIA?), Code § 2.2-3700 et seq., by denying her free entry to a public meeting of the Board, the trial court did not err in awarding relief to the plaintiff because the Board violated the statute, or in denying her claims against the individual defendants. The case is remanded for determination of the fees and costs she is entitled to recover since she substantially prevailed in the suit.
</p>

<p><a name="1220034_20230420"></a><a href="opinions/opnscvwp/1220034.pdf"> 220034</a> <b>Williams v. Commonwealth</b>  04/20/2023
The appellant pled guilty to an amended misdemeanor charge for obstruction of justice, and later filed a petition for expungement of the original felony charge of accessory-to-murder charge, which the Commonwealth did not oppose but the circuit court denied. Where a petitioner is convicted of a lesser included offense of the original charge, the original charge does not qualify for expungement. When a charge is not a lesser included offense, inquiry turns on whether it is a completely separate and unrelated charge and the petitioner may occupy the ?status of innocent.? Determining whether an amended charge is completely separate is not a mechanical application of the test under Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299 (1932). Rather, a court should (1) compare the conceptual similarities and differences between the charges and (2) examine whether they share a common nucleus of operative facts. The burden is on a petitioner to show that the original charge, later amended, qualifies as ?otherwise dismissed.? Here, the circuit court did not rely on a Blockburger comparison of the elements but on Code § 19.2-231, governing amendment of a charging instrument, to determine whether the amended obstruction of justice charge was completely separate from and unrelated to the original charge. Given this opinion?s clarification of the standard that applies to review of expungement petitions when the claim is that the original charge was ?otherwise dismissed,? the judgment below is reversed, and the case is remanded for new consideration of the petition.

<p><a name="1220185_20230413"></a><a href="opinions/opnscvwp/1220185.pdf"> 220185</a> <b>DeLuca v. Commonwealth (ORDER)</b>  04/13/2023
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed for the reasons stated in DeLuca v. Commonwealth, 73 Va. App. 567 (2021), holding that because the testimony of his own counsel was never ?prejudicial? to him, the attorney?s role as both lawyer and witness was not automatically prohibited by the lawyer-witness rule, and the attorney acted at all relevant times as the defendant?s counsel, both nominally and in fact, thus this defendant?s right to counsel was not violated. Further, because the record supports the conclusions that, despite his claims at the hearing, the defendant was not mistaken about his reporting obligation when he entered certain pleas, and that the motion to withdraw was filed in bad faith, the trial court did not err in refusing to allow him to withdraw his guilty pleas.

In an appeal from the circuit court?s grant of summary judgment in a case arising under Virginia?s ?Lemon Law,? Code § 59.1-207.9 et seq., to satisfy the refund requirements under the statute, a manufacturer is not required to pay pre-litigation attorney?s fees. In this case, because the manufacturer?s refund satisfied the requirements of the Lemon Law, the trial court?s grant of summary judgment is affirmed.

<p><a name="1220039_20230330"></a><a href="opinions/opnscvwp/1220039.pdf"> 220039</a> <b>Yourko v. Yourko</b>  03/30/2023
In an appeal from a decision in a divorce case on a husband?s motion to amend the final decree, the equitable distribution order, and a Military Pension Division Order (?MPDO?), in which a husband contended that the parties had erred in calculation of his disposable retired pay and, as a result, the MPDO required him to pay approximately 140% of his disposable retirement pay in violation of federal law, and further sought to have the indemnification provisions in the MPDO struck as void ab initio, the Court of Appeals erred in interpreting Howell v. Howell, 581 U.S. 214 (2017) to forbid courts from recognizing indemnification provisions related to military retirement pay in property settlement agreements, and further erred by overruling Owen v. Owen, 14 Va. App. 623 (1992) and its progeny. Regarding division of military retirement benefits, federal law does not prevent a husband and wife from entering into an agreement to provide a set level of payments, the amount of which is determined by considering disability benefits as well as retirement benefits. Nor does federal law bar courts from upholding such agreements or from enforcing indemnification provisions that may be included to ensure that payments are maintained as intended by the parties. The Court of Appeals? decision is reversed, and the circuit court?s decision dismissing the husband?s motion to amend the final decree is reinstated.

<p><a name="1211143_20230323"></a><a href="opinions/opnscvwp/1211143.pdf"> 211143</a> <b>Berry v. Board of Supervisors</b>  03/23/2023
In an appeal by resident taxpayers from a circuit court decision dismissing claims for declaratory and injunctive relief against a county Board of Supervisors, the County?s ?Continuity Ordinance? did not authorize the Board to consider and adopt a revised zoning ordinance in an electronic meeting, and neither that Ordinance nor Code § 15.2-1413 conflicted with or superseded VFOIA?s open meeting requirements. Nor did the General Assembly, in 2020 budget enactments, supplant VFOIA?s open meeting requirements or authorize the Board to adopt the zoning modification at meetings conducted by electronic means. The circuit court erred in concluding that the Board?s adoption of the revised zoning ordinance mooted the plaintiffs? declaratory judgment action and in dismissing the residents? complaint as premature. Neither the statute, nor the Continuity Ordinance, nor budget enactments by the General Assembly authorized the Board to consider and adopt the zoning modification in meetings conducted by electronic communication means without a quorum of the public body or any member of the governing board physically assembled at one location. Its purported adoption was void ab initio. The judgment below is reversed, and final judgment is entered on this appeal.

In an appeal from a conviction where the defendant had handed a note to a store cashier demanding money or her life, the cashier took the threat seriously because she saw the defendant place her hand in a pocket and point what appeared to be a handgun at the cashier. A jury convicted the defendant of using a firearm during the commission of a robbery. The judgment of the Court of Appeals (vacating the jury verdict, holding that the jury instructions were flawed and that no rational jury could find that the defendant had a firearm in her pocket) is reversed, rejecting both grounds relied upon by the Court of Appeals. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, the conviction entered by the circuit court is reinstated, and final judgment is entered for the Commonwealth.

<p><a name="1220230_20230209"></a><a href="opinions/opnscvwp/1220230.pdf"> 220230</a> <b>Horn v. Webb</b>  02/09/2023
In litigation between neighboring parties owning land near a lake, the evidence supports the circuit court?s rejection of a claimed prescriptive easement for the defendants to store small watercraft, such as canoes, on the plaintiff?s land, and an award of compensatory damages for such storage is affirmed. However, the judgment is reversed in connection with the claim of a prescriptive easement to dock a boat on the plaintiff?s property. Even if it is assumed that the original docking was permissive, the prior sale of the land vitiated the permission granted by the original owners. No evidence indicates that any of the subsequent owners granted any kind of permission to dock a boat on their land. Defendants established the existence of a prescriptive easement to dock a boat as well as to maintain the electrical wiring and outlet to charge the boat. Finally, award of punitive damages is reversed, because nothing in the record establishes malice on the part of the defendants in filing their own lawsuit to vindicate their property rights. Thus, the judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded for entry of an order consistent with the judgment of this Court.

<p><a name="1211021_20230202"></a><a href="opinions/opnscvwp/1211021.pdf"> 211021</a> <b>Morgan v. Board of Supervisors</b>  02/02/2023
In an action by several homeowners seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that the Board of Supervisors of Hanover County violated Virginia law when it approved rezoning and special-exception requests that authorized construction of a large distribution and warehousing facility nearby, the circuit court erred in finding that the homeowners? allegations did not allege a sufficient factual basis for standing. The court also erred when it dismissed Counts VI, VII, and VIII on the alternative ground that those Counts asserted speculative claims not ripe for adjudication. No opinion is offered, however, on the merits or demerits of the various claims pleaded by the homeowners or what, if any, judicial relief should be awarded at the conclusion of this case. The appealed judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.

<p><a name="1211226_20230126"></a><a href="opinions/opnscvwp/1211226.pdf"> 211226</a> <b>Colas v. Tyree</b>  01/26/2023
In a case arising from a police detective?s shooting of the decedent, testimony about the circumstances was received from the defendant detective called an adverse witness by the plaintiffs. The detective testified that, when he fired the fatal shot, he was acting in defense of another officer, because the decedent (who was experiencing acute mental distress) had been tackled by that officer, had fallen to the ground, had picked up a knife, and was holding the knife in the air in close proximity to the other officer, who was lying on the ground next to him. The plaintiffs? own uncontradicted evidence established that the defendant detective was justified in firing the shot. Applying the adverse party witness doctrine, the estate is bound by this uncontradicted evidence. Accordingly, the judgment awarding the plaintiffs damages on a theory of battery is reversed and final judgment is entered for the defendant detective.

In an appeal from denial of a petition to expunge a felony arrest record, since every driving-while-intoxicated charge implicates the same underlying offense, a violation of Code § 18.2-266, it is clear that Felony DWI and DWI Second involve the same offense but with different sentencing enhancements:  the difference between the two charges is one of degree and not of kind. In the present case, amendment of the arrest warrant related only to the sentencing enhancement sought to be imposed, not the underlying offense. Given that the actual offense that petitioner was charged with remained the same, it simply cannot be said that the amendment resulted in a completely separate and unrelated charge. Accordingly, the amendment did not render the original Felony DWI charge ?otherwise dismissed? for the purposes of Code § 19.2-392.2, and therefore, the circuit court properly dismissed the expungement petition.

On remand from the decision in International Paper Co. v. County of Isle of Wight, 299 Va. 150 (2020), the circuit court held that International Paper had established by a preponderance of the evidence that the County?s tax scheme violated the requirement of uniform taxation in the Constitution of Virginia, and it ordered a full refund of the taxpayer?s machinery and tools tax (?M&amp;T tax?) for the applicable year. The County?s appeal from this decision, contending that the circuit court erred in finding its tax scheme unconstitutional, and, in the alternative, that it erred in the relief it granted, is rejected, and the circuit court?s judgment is affirmed across the board.

In an appeal from a conviction for carrying a concealed weapon while intoxicated in violation of Code § 18.2-308.012, the rule of lenity applies, an ancient maxim of the law that all such statutes must be construed strictly against the state and favorably to the liberty of the citizen. By enacting this statute, the General Assembly specifically targeted persons permitted to carry concealed handguns and sought to prevent them from carrying a handgun in a public place while intoxicated, it did not envision preventing the transportation of a handgun within a bag located in a vehicle. Rather, the legislature sought something more specific, intending to deter intoxicated individuals from physically carrying a concealed handgun ? whether it be in their waistband, pocket, etc. ? in and out of public establishments. In this case, the defendant had a valid concealed weapons permit and provided it to the officer during the traffic stop. He did not physically carry the handgun on his person, but rather, the handgun was holstered in a small, zipped backpack on the front passenger seat of his vehicle. Under these facts, this defendant did not ?carry? the handgun as contemplated by Code § 18.2-308.012, and his conviction was in error. The conviction is reversed.

In a surety company?s appeal from a circuit court judgment striking its conversion and unjust enrichment claims (after disallowing a forensic accounting asset-tracing expert to testify), the governing legal principle is that when a company obtains a right through subrogation, it is placed in the position of its subrogor and can have no greater rights than those of the subrogor. Both of the surety company?s assignments of error stem from the circuit court?s underlying legal conclusion that it was incapable of demonstrating a priority right to the disputed funds as a matter of law. Because the surety company?s rights were limited to those of its subrogor, a mechanical contracting company, the judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.

In an appeal by two related insurance companies from a decision of the circuit court granting summary judgment to an insured on the issue of whether each of the two insurance policies at issue provided separate tranches of insurance for uninsured motorist (?UM?) coverage and underinsured motorist (?UIM?) coverage, the circuit court erred in its interpretation of Code § 38.2-2206 and the insurance policies. The statute and each of the applicable policies provide only a single tranche of coverage applicable to both UM and UIM claims.

In an appeal by owners of land from a circuit court order that they convey it in fee simple after an auction was held, the auction, as advertised, was an auction with reserve because the advertisement did not state that it would be an absolute auction. The owners never explicitly stated that the auction was absolute or without reserve during the pre-auction announcement; nor was any statement made that limited the ability to withdraw the property from sale, reject bids or otherwise nullify the auction. A statement that property will be sold to the high bidder is a mere declaration of intention to hold an auction at which bids will be received. Such statements are usually merely preliminary negotiation, not intended or reasonably understood to affect legal relations, and the owner?s statement was virtually identical to language included in the advertisement, which plaintiff conceded indicated that the auction was an auction with reserve. Accordingly, the circuit court erred in its determination that the auction was an absolute auction, and its judgment compelling conveyance of the property to the plaintiff is reversed. Final judgment is entered for the defendant owners.

Examining six attributes pertinent to a determination whether a particular entity occupies the status of a municipal corporation, the defendant board lacks two of the criteria entirely and only possesses some of the characteristics of two others. Prior case law indicates that the more statutory autonomy the entity possesses and exercises the more likely it is to be declared a municipal corporation, and here ? when compared to other entities operating under more autonomous statutory authority ? the defendant board looks less like a municipal corporation than an auxiliary of the establishing authorities. Here, the circuit court erred in finding that the defendant board possessed sufficient attributes of a municipal corporation. The pivotal point in this case is whether the defendant board is immune from tort liability and case law has consistently described the nature and scope of a claimed immunity as a matter of substantive state law. The circuit court erred in granting the plea in bar, as the defendant is not entitled to sovereign immunity. The judgment of the circuit court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.

In an appeal from a decision of the Virginia State Bar Disciplinary Board, no error is found. The Board has broad discretion when imposing sanctions, and on appeal the penalty imposed will be viewed as prima facie correct and will not be disturbed unless it is determined, upon independent review of the record, that the penalty was not justified by the evidence or was contrary to law. Here, the attorney?s 18-month suspension was an appropriate sanction. The evidence established that he engaged in a long pattern of dishonest conduct in multiple jurisdictions and had previously been disciplined for similar forms of misconduct. The Board has the authority to set the effective date of a sanction and, in determining the effective date of a sanction, its decision is subject to review for an abuse of discretion.

In a prosecution on multiple counts of computer solicitation of a minor in violation of Code § 18.2-374.3(C), the circuit court?s exclusion at trial of expert testimony offered to show that the defendant did not believe he was communicating with a minor, and that he lacked any motive to solicit a minor, if error, was harmless as a matter of law. In this case, the appellant has waived any argument that the claimed error in excluding the defense expert?s testimony violated his due process rights or any other constitutional principle. Thus, the decision may be upheld on the ground that any evidentiary error involved is harmless if it can be concluded that it did not influence the jury or had but slight effect. To reach this conclusion, the evidence of guilt must be so overwhelming that it renders the error insignificant by comparison such that the error could not have affected the verdict. Here, taken as a whole, the evidence of the defendant?s prurient interest in the person he was communicating with was overwhelming and, therefore, the proffered expert testimony on motive would not have influenced the jury or would have had but slight effect. Thus, any presumed error in excluding the expert testimony was harmless. The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.

The petition ? while making reference to ?Roanoke City? and ?City of Roanoke? ? failed to name the Roanoke City Council as a party as required by Code § 15.2-2314. Failure to name the governing body as a necessary party within the 30-day window contemplated by the statute is a defect that, when timely raised, requires dismissal of the petition. The argument that petitioners should be permitted to amend their complaint under Code § 8.01-6 is also rejected, since ?Roanoke City? is a misnomer for the City, not the Council. As the City is not the proper party to the petition, the repeated references to ?Roanoke City? amount to a misjoinder, rather than a misnomer, and accordingly Code § 8.01-6 has no application in this case.

In a condominium association?s in personam claim against the former owner of two units for unpaid special assessments, alleging breach of a provision in the condominium declaration requiring payment of all prior assessments at the time units are sold to new owners, the circuit court erred in holding that the association?s failure to introduce the declaration into evidence at an ore tenus hearing precluded it from deciding whether to grant or deny the plea in bar on this issue. The declaration, conveyance deed, and settlement statement were all made exhibits to the association?s complaint, and the former unit owner stipulated that his plea in bar assumed arguendo the factual allegations in the amended complaint. The circuit court?s holding that the declaration could not be considered is reversed and this case is remanded for further proceedings.

In an action controlled by Uniform Commercial Code provisions regarding presentation, payment or dishonor of checks in the banking industry, as enacted in the codes of both Virginia and West Virginia, the plaintiff niece ? who was a Payable on Death (POD) beneficiary of a Virginia bank account held by her aunt ? did not have a vested interest in a check drawn on the aunt?s West Virginia bank when it was initially presented for payment, and she therefore could not rely on the prompt payment of the check. Consequently, she did not have standing to enforce the midnight deadline rule under the statutes, and her eventual acquisition of the Virginia account after the aunt died failed to alter the fact that she could not rely on the prompt payment of the check when it was initially presented to the West Virginia bank. Nor could she rely on prompt payment following a second presentment of the check in light of the particular circumstances of this case. Accordingly, the circuit court did not err when it granted the West Virginia bank?s motion for summary judgment, denied the plaintiff niece?s motions related to the second presentment, and dismissed her amended complaint.

An appeal in an easement dispute has been rendered moot by sale of one of the properties involved, and the parties agree that the trial court?s judgment should be vacated. There is no longer any live controversy to be resolved, nor do the parties have any legal interest in the outcome of this appeal. When a prevailing party voluntarily and unilaterally moots a case, preventing an appellant from obtaining appellate review, vacatur of lower court judgments is generally appropriate and ensures that those who have been prevented from obtaining the review to which they are entitled are not treated as if there had been a review. Vacatur strips the decision below of its binding effect and clears the path for future relitigation. With this understanding, this appeal is dismissed as moot and the trial court?s judgment is vacated. Because this case is now moot, leaving no substantially prevailing party on appeal, the request to tax costs against the appellee is denied, and each party is ordered to pay his own respective, incurred costs.

In a rape case where one police officer had translated during a detective?s crime-scene interrogation of the defendant, but a different officer testified at trial ? translating independently from body-camera footage of the same interview ? there was no violation of the defendant?s rights under the Confrontation Clause of the United States Constitution. Assuming, without deciding, that statements translated from one language into another by a translator can constitute testimonial evidence, thus triggering the protections of the Confrontation Clause, those protections were satisfied here because the translator whose evidence was used at trial testified in person, subject to cross-examination.

A judgment of the Court of Appeals affirming the circuit court?s revocation of a defendant?s deferred disposition and convicting him for possession of heroin ? due to his failure to pay court costs as provided in a plea agreement and deferral order ? is affirmed. Statutes that permit the circuit court to impose alternatives to incarceration are highly remedial and use of these tools lies within the broad discretion of the circuit court. The plain language of Code § 18.2-251 states that, upon violation of a term or condition, the court may enter an adjudication of guilt and, in this case, it is undisputed that the payment of court costs was included as a term or condition of the deferral order. Here, the defendant?s obligation to pay court costs was an express condition of his deferred finding of guilt originated with his plea agreement. The judgment of the Court of Appeals upholding the conviction is affirmed.

In a bill of review proceeding brought by owners of property arguably used for religious purposes to challenge a decree of sale for delinquency in tax payments, the circuit court erred when it dismissed the bill of review on the theory that the underlying action was an action at law. The circuit court further erred when it held that because more than three years had passed since these taxes were assessed, they were beyond review and that the property owners could not raise any defenses to the assessments. The judgment is reversed, and this matter is remanded to the circuit court for a determination whether the property in question was used for religious worship as defined in Code § 58.1-3606, and consequently whether any delinquent taxes were owed on the property.

In an appeal of right from a decision of the Virginia State Bar Disciplinary Board suspending an attorney?s his license to practice law for four years, no error is found in the Board?s decision. Upon reviewing the present case, under established legal standards, it is concluded that the Board did not err when it determined that the Virginia attorney violated Rules 3.3, 3.4, 4.1, and 8.4 of the Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct. The plain language of these Rules establishes that associate members are attorneys who remain subject to the Bar?s jurisdiction and regulation, and the Bar acted within its authority when it pursued disciplinary action against this Virginia attorney for actions committed while he was an associate member of the Bar.

Since there was no verdict holding that the paramedics were not negligent, however, the immunity of the paramedics was not a sufficient basis for finding that the rescue service itself was immune from this claim.

In prosecution for misdemeanor reckless driving in violation of Code § 46.2-852, the requisite mens rea requires a reckless disregard by the driver for the consequences of his act and an indifference to the safety of life, limb, or property of others; what distinguishes a speeding violation from misdemeanor of reckless driving, and the misdemeanor from felony of involuntary manslaughter, is the likelihood of injury to other users of the highways. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party prevailing at trial, a rational trier of fact could reasonably infer from the evidence that this accident was not the result of a mere split-second, momentary failure to keep a lookout, an act of simple negligence ? but rather a lengthy, total, and complete failure to keep a lookout, satisfying the recklessness requirement to support a conviction for reckless driving. The Court of Appeals erroneously held as a matter of law that no rational jury could have found this defendant guilty of reckless driving. That judgment is reversed, and the trial court?s conviction order is reinstated.

Evidence presented at a plea-in-bar hearing, describing the specific circumstances of a fatal assault, coupled with allegations in the complaint, demonstrate that the probability of assault was augmented either because of the particular character of the victim?s job or because of the special liability to assault associated with the environment in which the victim was required to work.

In the context of robbery, a good faith or bona fide claim of right to the property taken negates the mens rea element of the offense, but the claim-of-right defense requires a predicate showing of good faith, or a bona fide belief by the taking party that he has some legal right to the property taken. In the present case, the evidence plainly established that the stolen money was ?drug money,? earned through illegal drug transactions, and the record does not contain more than a scintilla of evidence to establish that the defendant had a good faith or bona fide claim of right to the stolen money. While he may have subjectively believed that the victim and his girlfriend stole the money from defendant?s drug dealing partner, defendant was never legally entitled to possess the money at issue, which was itself a form of contraband, and he could not have possessed the money in good faith.
