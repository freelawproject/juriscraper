(collectively, Plaintiffs), appeal from trial court orders (1) granting summary judgment in favor of Defendant and Third-Party Plaintiff Joyce K. Brown, as Trustee of the Joyce Brown Trust Dated 12/31/1992, and as Trustee of the Dorsey N. Brown Trust dated 12/31/1992, and (2) granting attorney fees to Defendant. Third-Party Defendants Gloria Shadid and Steve Wood also appeal the order granting summary judgment in favor of Defendant. This appeal has been assigned to the accelerated docket pursuant to Oklahoma Supreme Court Rule 1.36, 12 O.S.2021, ch. 15, app. 1, and stands submitted without additional briefing. The issue presented is whether the trial court erred in finding no material undisputed fact questions remain and that Defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and secondarily, whether the trial court properly granted attorney fees to Defendant in the wake of the summary judgment. After review, we conclude it was error to grant summary judgment in favor of Defendant and Third-Party Plaintiff, and we reverse the summary judgment and the attorney fee order.",

The questions to be addressed on appeal in this libel action are whether summary judgment was granted in error and whether the denial of Wiley's motion for new trial was an abuse of discretion. We consider this appeal without further briefing pursuant to Oklahoma Supreme Court Rule 1.36, 12 O.S.2021, ch. 15, app. 1. After review, we conclude overruling the motion for new trial was an abuse of discretion because the question of whether the article in question was substantially accurate was for a jury to decide, and granting summary judgment in Defendants' favor was therefore erroneous. We reverse the orders of the trial court and remand for further proceedings.",

Lifetouch holds a judgment against Tulsa School Pictures, L.L.C., which it seeks to collect from Oklahoma School Pictures in this action. Lifetouch contends that Tulsa School Pictures is the alter ego or, \"mere instrumentality\" of Oklahoma School Pictures and argues that disregarding the separate legal existence of Tulsa School Pictures is necessary to protect the rights of third persons and accomplish justice. The appeal has been assigned to the accelerated docket pursuant to Oklahoma Supreme Court Rule 1.36, 12 O.S.2021, ch. 15, app. 1. Viewing the summary judgment record most favorably to Lifetouch, there are unresolved issues of fact regarding the separate existence of Tulsa School Pictures and whether it was the instrumentality of Oklahoma School Pictures. We reverse the judgment in favor of Oklahoma School Pictures and remand for further proceedings to determine that issue.",

Bell and the Bell Law Firm, LPPC (collectively \"Bell\"), in this attorney's fee dispute. Garrett sought declaratory judgment as to the enforceability of a fee-splitting or referral agreement against Bell, and asserted various related contract and tort claims. 1 Bell asserted that an agreement to share fees on any particular case was unenforceable under Oklahoma Rule of Professional Conduct 1.5(e), and that Garrett's claims to fees should have been brought during proceedings for fees before the Workers' Compensation Court of Existing Claims (CEC) and were barred by the doctrine of res judicata or claim preclusion. The district court granted summary judgment to Bell. On review of the applicable law and the record, we affirm the trial court's judgment of December 21, 2022, in part, with respect to eighteen cases Bell did not litigate in the CEC, and reverse the remainder of the district court's judgment, and remand for further proceedings.",
