    "summaries": "District courts must consider the Ruff-Fischer guidelines, the needs of the spouse seeking support, and the ability of the other spouse to pay when determining whether to award spousal support. A party who fails to provide evidence of net income waives any argument that he or she did not have the ability to pay spousal support. A district court considers the Ruff-Fischer factors when distributing marital property. The court must consider the length of a marriage in determining an equitable division of the marital estate under the Ruff-Fischer guidelines. In a short-term marriage, the court may return to the parties what they brought into the marriage, but the division of property and debt must be equitable. The guiding principle for an award of attorney's fees is one party's need and the other party's ability to pay. The district court may also consider whether a party's actions have unreasonably increased the time and efforts spent on the dispute.",

When a defendant fails to object to a proposed instruction properly, or fails to specifically request an instruction or object to the omission of an instruction, the issue is not adequately preserved for appellate review and our inquiry is limited to whether the jury instructions constitute obvious error affecting substantial rights. When prosecutorial misconduct is raised for the first time on appeal, review is limited to determining whether the prosecutor's conduct prejudicially affected the defendant's substantial rights, so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial.

However, newly raised issues may be addressed on appeal if the issue rises to the level of obvious error.

The rationale for this principle is that allowing an administrative agency to promulgate rules that include substantive matters not included in the statute under which it is acting constitutes an improper delegation of legislative power. The legislature has not specifically authorized WSI to promulgate rules regulating the proof required to establish compensability for a mental or psychological condition.

In order to determine whether an investigative stop is valid, we consider the totality of the circumstances and examine the information known to the officer at the time of the stop. An officer is required to administer the Miranda warning when a person is subject to custodial interrogation. A suspect is in custody when there is a formal arrest or restraint on the suspect's freedom of movement to the degree associated with a formal arrest.

By operating as a condition on a county's approval of the act of subdivision, a subdivision ordinance's setback provisions do not function as a direct zoning regulation in conflict with a township's exclusive zoning authority. A county's subdivision authority begins when an action is taken to divide a parcel into two or more parts.

Absent verbal consent, the State must show affirmative conduct by the person alleged to have consented that is consistent with the giving of consent, rather than merely showing that the person took no affirmative actions to stop the police. The existence of consent is a question of fact to be determined from the totality of the circumstances. The scope of an individual's consent is determined by considering what an objectively reasonable person would have understood the consent to include. Whether consent was voluntarily given considers examination of the totality of the circumstances at the time it was given. Factors that may be considered in determining the totality of the circumstances are the characteristics and condition of the accused at the time of consent and the details of the setting in which consent was obtained, though no one factor is determinative.",

    "summaries": "Under N.D.R.Ev. 404(b), district courts are to apply a three-step analysis to determine whether the evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is admissible: 1) the court must look to the purpose for which the evidence is introduced; 2) the evidence of the prior act or acts must be substantially reliable or clear and convincing; and 3) in criminal cases, there must be proof of the crime charged which permits the trier of fact to establish the defendant's guilt or innocence independently on the evidence presented, without consideration of the evidence of the prior acts. Under N.D.R.Crim.P. 52, any error, defect, irregularity or variance that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded. When reviewing a nonconstitutional trial error, the objective is to determine whether the error was so prejudicial that substantial injury occurred and a different decision would have resulted without the error. Under N.D.R.Ev. 103(a)(1)(B), an objection to the introduction of evidence must state the specific ground of the objection unless it was apparent from the context. Only issues that have been thoroughly briefed and argued are considered on appeal. The standard of review for reconciling a jury verdict is whether the verdict is legally inconsistent. Strict standards of logical consistency need not be applied to jury verdicts in criminal cases. Reconciliation of a verdict includes an examination of both the law and the case in order to determine whether the verdict is logical and probable, and therefore consistent, or illogical and clearly contrary to the evidence. Even if a jury fails to convict a defendant on a charge having a similar element to a charge on which the defendant is convicted, there is no legal inconsistency if there is substantial evidence to support the charge on which he is convicted. 1Jury instructions agreed to by a defendant become the law of the case.",

Applying a statute retroactively results in the attachment of new legal consequences to past matters. Applying a statute prospectively results in the attachment of legal consequences to matters occurring after its effective date. The court must ask whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment. A debtor is allowed to claim as exempt up to $150,000 of equity in the homestead under N.D.C.C. ch. 47-18. This is accomplished by requiring bids to be more than $150,000 plus the value of liens and encumbrances. See N.D.C.C. \u00a7\u00a7 47-18-01 and 47-18-13.

    "summaries": "Summary judgment should not constitute mini-trials of factual issues and is not appropriate when the court must draw inferences or make findings on disputed facts. The elements of a prima facie case for breach of contract are: (1) the existence of a contract; (2) breach of the contract; and (3) damages which flow from the breach. A breach of contract is the nonperformance of a contractual duty when it is due. While construction of a written contract to determine its legal effect presents a question of law, whether a party has breached a contract is a finding of fact. An interference with contract claim contemplates a tortfeasor who either prevented a third party from entering into a contract or induced the third party to breach the contract with the plaintiff. To establish a prima facie case for intentional interference with contract, a plaintiff must prove (1) a contract existed, (2) the contract was breached, (3) the defendant instigated the breach, and (4) the defendant instigated the breach without justification. To prevail on an intentional interference with contract claim, the plaintiff must show the defendant acted intentionally, and the intent required goes beyond the traditional tort concept of intent. The plaintiff must show the defendant specifically intended to interfere with the plaintiff's contractual rights, or acted with knowledge that the interference would result. A party's intent generally presents a question of fact. An indemnity is a contract by which one engages to save another from a legal consequence of the conduct of one of the parties or of some other person. Indemnification is a remedy which allows a party to recover reimbursement from another for the discharge of a liability which, as between them, should have been discharged by the other.",
