    "summaries": "The main issues in this post-divorce appeal concern the trial court's rulings on the parties' requests for attorney's fees. In addition to the post-divorce proceedings, the husband filed a declaratory judgment petition to determine the amount he owed the wife under the parties' marital dissolution agreement (\"the MDA\"). The husband and the wife then engaged in protracted litigation to determine the amount owed. The husband later amended the declaratory judgment petition to include a request to modify alimony. The parties resolved the declaratory judgment petition by providing the trial court with an amount upon which they agreed. The husband then voluntarily nonsuited the petition to modify alimony. Both parties sought an award of attorney's fees pursuant to the MDA. The trial court determined that the husband was the successful party in the declaratory judgment action and that there was no successful party in the request to modify alimony. The court declined to award either party attorney's fees. The wife appealed, asserting that she was the successful party in both actions and that the court should have awarded her attorney's fees to her. The wife also challenged discovery sanctions entered against her. First, we determine that the declaratory judgment action did not fall under the fee provision of the parties' MDA. Therefore, the trial court erred in finding the husband to be the successful party in that action; we affirm the portion of the order declining to award either party attorney's fees. Next, based upon a recent decision of our Supreme Court, we determine that the wife was the successful party in the petition to modify alimony and reverse the trial court's decision to the contrary. We affirm the imposition of discovery sanctions.",

    "summaries": "Following a bench trial in this divorce action, the trial court granted a divorce to the wife on the ground of inappropriate marital conduct. The court entered a permanent parenting plan order, designating the wife as the primary residential parent to the parties' four minor children and granting the husband 144 days of annual residential co-parenting time. In what the court found to be an equitable division of the marital estate, it awarded to the wife $303,260.00 in marital assets, which included the equity in and possession of the marital residence and her marital share of the husband's military retirement. The husband received $274,097.10 in marital assets, which included the equity in and possession of an unimproved parcel of real property. The court directed that the wife would be responsible for the mortgage owed on the marital residence but also directed that the wife would not be required to refinance the mortgage debt until the youngest child had reached the age of eighteen years. Finding the wife to be the economically disadvantaged spouse and expressly finding that she was not voluntarily underemployed, the court awarded to her $5,000.00 monthly in transitional alimony for a period of six years, to be offset by her share of the husband's military retirement benefits upon his retirement. However, the court specified that \"[t]he amount of $5,000.00 is a global amount which shall include the child support obligation owed by [the husband].\" Based on the child support guidelines, the court ordered the husband to pay $1,992.00 monthly in child support. The court further awarded to the wife $10,127.00 in reasonable attorney's fees as alimony in solido. The husband has appealed. Discerning no reversible error, we affirm the trial court's judgment with the minor modification of an added provision stating that the wife will indemnify and hold the husband harmless for the mortgage debt on the marital residence until it is paid in full or refinanced. We also award to the wife her reasonable attorney's fees incurred on appeal.",

    "summaries": "At issue is a purely legal question, the interpretation and application of \"other insurance\" clauses in two respective insurance policies that determine which policy provides primary coverage and which provides excess coverage to the property management company in the underlying premises liability action. HG Jones, LLC, d/b/a Real Property Management Solutions (\"HG Jones\"), is the manager of property owned by Jordan Howell (\"Mr. Howell\"). Both are defendants in the underlying premises liability action. HG Jones is the named insured under a Commercial General Liability Policy issued by Auto-Owners Insurance Company (\"Auto-Owners\"). Mr. Howell is the named insured in a Dwelling and Personal Property Coverage Policy issued by The Cincinnati Insurance Company (\"Cincinnati\"). In this action, HG Jones sought a declaration that Cincinnati had a duty to defend and indemnify HG Jones in the premises liability action as the primary insurer because HG Jones qualifies as an \"insured\" as that term is defined in the Cincinnati policy. For its part, Cincinnati claimed that its policy only provides excess coverage over HG Jones Auto-Owners' policy based, inter alia, on the \"other insurance\" clauses in the two policies and the fact that HG Jones was not specifically listed as an \"additional insured\" under the Cincinnati policy. The parties filed competing motions for judgment on the pleadings. The trial court determined that there was no legal distinction between the terms \"insured\" and \"additional insured\" and HG Jones was an insured under the Cincinnati policy. Therefore, the court ruled that Cincinnati had the primary duty to defend and indemnify HG Jones in the premises liability action. Cincinnati appeals. We have determined that the \"other insurance\" clauses set forth in the two policies must be deemed void because they are mutually repugnant. Because HG Jones is the named insured under the Auto-Owners' policy and HG Jones is an insured under the Cincinnati policy by virtue of the definition of an \"insured\" under that policy, both policies afford HG Jones primary coverage. Thus, the duty to defend and indemnify HG Jones in the premises liability action must be prorated between Cincinnati and Auto-Owners. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.",

After the defendant failed to file a timely responsive pleading to the complaint, the trial court entered a default judgment on the issue of liability. Prior to the trial on damages, the defendant moved to set aside the default judgment on the ground of excusable neglect. The claimed excuse was based on the contention that the defendant was the named executor and sole beneficiary under a purported 2020 will. The trial court rejected that argument because there was no pending will contest and the defendant had not filed a petition to admit the purported will to probate. The trial court also denied the motion to set aside upon the finding that the defendant's failure to file a responsive pleading was willful. After a trial on damages, the court invalidated a quitclaim deed, ordered the return of personal property, and awarded $48,500 in compensatory damages and $97,000 in punitive damages against the defendant.

Arguing that it was immune from liability for the alleged misconduct, the city moved to dismiss the complaint. The trial court dismissed the complaint with prejudice. We conclude that the city is immune from liability for the asserted negligence under the public duty doctrine and that the allegations in the complaint do not support application of the special duty exception. So we affirm the dismissal.",

    "summaries": "Leslie K. Jones (\"Mr. Jones\"), an at-will support staff employee of Tennessee State University (\"TSU\"), appeals the termination of his employment. His at-will employment agreement provided for fourteen days-notice prior to termination of his employment. When he received a termination notice on March 1, 2012, Mr. Jones filed a grievance. TSU responded advising Mr. Jones that he could not grieve his termination because he was terminated under the terms of his at-will employment agreement \"without cause.\" Following extensive delays and a declaratory judgment action in a related proceeding, TSU was ordered to afford Mr. Jones a grievance hearing pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 49-8- 117(a)(1). Following an evidentiary hearing, the Hearing Officer found that \"[TSU] was not obligated to provide a reason for termination under the terms of the employment contract;\" nevertheless, he found that good cause for his termination had been established. Therefore, the Hearing Officer ruled that his termination should be upheld. After TSU's President upheld the Hearing Officer's decision, Mr. Jones filed a petition seeking judicial review pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 4-5-322. The chancellor affirmed and dismissed the petition with prejudice. Mr. Jones appeals. On appeal, TSU insists that its compliance with the notice provision of the employment agreement is the substantial and material evidence needed to uphold the Hearing Officer's ruling. We disagree. As this court explained in Lawrence v. Rawlins, No. M1997-00223-COA-R3-CV, 2001 WL 76266, at 3 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 30, 2001), \"[w]hen the General Assembly enacted Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 49-8-117 in 1993, it modified the employment-will-relationship between the educational institutions in the . . . State University and Community College System [which includes TSU] and their 'support staff.'\" The statute requires these educational institutions to establish a grievance procedure for their support staff, which \"must cover employee complaints relating to adverse employment actions[.]\" Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 49-8- 117(b)(2)(A). Finding that Mr. Jones's employment could only be terminated \"for cause\" or as part of \"a bona fide reduction in force,\" neither of which was the basis of Mr. Jones's termination, we reverse the judgment of the chancery court and the Hearing Officer and remand with instructions for the Hearing Officer to, inter alia, ascertain the relief and benefits Mr. Jones is entitled to receive.",

    "summaries": "This case concerns a dispute regarding attorney's fees. Appellee is the next of kin of the attorney who represented Appellants for a period of time in the underlying wrongful death action. After Appellants terminated his representation, the attorney filed a notice of attorney's lien. A few years later, while represented by their new counsel, Appellants settled their claims against the underlying defendants. While pursuing the attorney's lien, the attorney died. Thereafter, the attorney's estate was substituted as a party. In a previous appeal, we reviewed the trial court's $133,333.33 attorney's fee award to the attorney's estate. We affirmed the trial court's conclusion that Appellants owe the attorney's estate fees and that the result the attorney obtained for Appellants was a $400,000.00 settlement offer. In the first appeal, we vacated the $133,333.33 attorney's fee award and remanded the case with instructions for the trial court to make findings consistent with Rule 1.5(a) of the Tennessee Rules of Professional Conduct. Following remand, the attorney's estate was closed, and Appellee sought to be substituted, individually, as a party to this action. The trial court allowed the substitution, over Appellants' objections. Concerning the amount of attorney's fees, the trial court referred the parties to a special master, who disregarded this Court's prior opinion, wherein we affirmed that the \"results obtained\" by the deceased attorney was a $400,000.00 settlement offer. Rather, the special master concluded that the \"results obtained\" was a $450,000.00 settlement offer and awarded attorney's fees of $150,000.00 based on that amount. The trial court adopted the special master's findings. Although we affirm the trial court's substitution of Appellee as a party, we vacate the award of $150,000.00 in attorney's fees as this amount is in conflict with the law of the case, i.e., this Court's previous conclusion that the results the attorney obtained was a $400,000.00 settlement offer.",

    "summaries": "Appellant, who pleaded guilty to two counts of first-degree murder and is currently serving two life sentences, filed a complaint in the Hamblen County Chancery Court, alleging that he was not given proper credit for time served. Appellant specifically sought credit for the time he was confined in Texas while fighting his extradition to Tennessee. In his complaint, Appellant requested that the trial court compel the Defendants to enforce the judgments to give him credit for time served and further requested that the Defendants be found in contempt for failure to do so. The trial court dismissed Appellant's complaint based on collateral estoppel, finding that the criminal court that entered the judgments previously denied Appellant's request for pretrial jail credits. Appellant appeals the dismissal of his complaint. We conclude that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction; thus, we dismiss the appeal.",
