The handyman counterclaimed for the value of the oral contract for services, asserting the homeowner breached the contract by improperly terminating it. The circuit court denied relief to both parties, and the parties appeal. We conclude that the circuit court did not err in determining that there was no enforceable contract, precluding relief for the handyman. Likewise, the homeowner is not entitled to relief because the evidence does not preponderate against the circuit court's finding that there was no misrepresentation and that the handyman rendered services to earn certain prepaid amounts. The judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.",

Following a hearing, the trial court determined that the defendant had complied with article VI, section 4 of the Tennessee Constitution because the clause required, inter alia, that he be a resident within the judicial district, not necessarily within the city limits, to preside over the municipal court, which has concurrent jurisdiction with a general sessions court. The plaintiff has appealed. Upon review, we determine that the language of article VI, section 4 of the Tennessee Constitution requiring a judge elected to an inferior court to have been a resident of the \"district or circuit\" to which he or she is assigned means, under these circumstances, that the Lenoir City Municipal Judge must have been a resident of Loudon County for at least one year prior to the judge's election because the Lenoir City Municipal Court has concurrent jurisdiction with the Loudon County General Sessions Court. Accordingly, inasmuch as the defendant had been a resident of Loudon County for at least one year prior to the election, we affirm the trial court's dismissal of the plaintiff's election contest. However, we modify the trial court's judgment to state that the defendant complied with the residency requirement at issue because he had been a resident of Loudon County for at least one year rather than because he had been a resident of the Ninth Judicial District for the prescribed time period.",

This appeal arises from a civil action in which the plaintiff has brought claims of fraud and civil conspiracy against his former counsel in a criminal case that resulted in a conviction and his counsel in a pending post-conviction case. While this civil action was pending, the trial court allowed the attorneys who were representing the plaintiff in the post-conviction case to withdraw. Shortly thereafter, the plaintiff filed a recusal motion, contending that the trial judge should be recused because he showed bias in favor of the plaintiff's post-conviction attorneys when he granted their motions to withdraw without a hearing, during which the plaintiff wished to share his grievances about the attorneys. The trial court denied the plaintiff's recusal motion, and this Rule 10B appeal followed. We have concluded that neither the legal grounds nor the evidence that the plaintiff relies upon in his affidavit in support of the recusal motion are sufficient to prompt a reasonable, disinterested person to reasonably question the judge's impartiality. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court denying the motion for recusal is affirmed.",

    "summaries": "The plaintiff, John H. Packard, IV (\"Plaintiff\") was struck by a vehicle driven by Jonathan R. Bentley while Plaintiff attempted to walk across a roadway in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Plaintiff brought a suit arising in negligence against a number of parties, including the City of Gatlinburg (\"City\"). As to City, Plaintiff alleged that it created an unreasonably dangerous risk of harm to pedestrians attempting to use the crosswalk because it failed to inspect and maintain LED lights it had previously installed on a nearby crosswalk sign. The Circuit Court for Sevier County (\"trial court\") granted summary judgment in favor of City, finding that City negated an essential element of Plaintiff's claim, that City was entitled to immunity pursuant to the Tennessee Governmental Tort Liability Act (\"GTLA\"), Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-20-101 et seq., and that City was also immune pursuant to the public duty doctrine. Finding no error, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.",
