The trial court imposed a six-and-a-half-year sentence. On appeal, the defendant contends the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his conviction of reckless endangerment with a deadly weapon of Isabella Edwards. The defendant also argues the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury as to a presumption of reasonableness in the use of deadly force within his residence. Following our review, we affirm the defendant's convictions.",

    "summaries": "This is a State appeal, filed by the State Attorney General and Reporter, from the entry of an order granting the petitioner's, Courtney Anderson's, motion to reopen his postconviction and amending/reducing his original sentence of 162 years, 11 months, and 29 days to a time served sentence of 25 years. The State appealed, arguing the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear the petitioner's motion as it was barred by the one-year statute of limitations and the petitioner failed to prove the statute should be tolled. Additionally, the State submits that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to amend the petitioner's sentence under the post-conviction statute and that the trial court's actions amount to an improper commutation of the petitioner's sentence. The petitioner contends that the State waived any challenge to the statute of limitations by failing to raise the issue below and that his claim meets the requirements of the statute and allows for the tolling of the statute, and therefore, the trial court properly granted the relief requested. Upon our thorough review of the applicable law and the briefs and arguments of both parties, we conclude that the instant petition is barred by the one-year statute of limitations and that the petitioner failed to establish and the trial court failed to find a proper basis for tolling the statute. Accordingly, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear the petitioner's motion and amend the petitioner's sentence. Therefore, we reverse the decision of the trial court, reinstate the petitioner's original sentence, and remand this matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.",

Defendant did not seek a direct appeal of his sentence. Instead, Defendant filed a motion pursuant to Rule 36.1 of the Tennessee Rules of Criminal Procedure in which he argued that his sentence was illegal.
