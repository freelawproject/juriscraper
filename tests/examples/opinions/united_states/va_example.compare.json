However, defendant never argued at trial that the proffered testimony was offered for impeachment purposes; rather, he only argued that it was not alibi evidence. As a result, defendant?s argument was waived. That portion of the Court of Appeals? judgment is reversed, but judgment upholding the conviction is affirmed.",

The circuit court erred in failing to so rule, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.",

While the Double Jeopardy Clause imposes some restrictions on a trial court?s authority to reconsider a motion to strike, those limitations do not apply here. Consequently, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and final judgment is entered on this appeal in favor of the Commonwealth.",
