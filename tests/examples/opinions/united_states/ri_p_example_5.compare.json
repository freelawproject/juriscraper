    "summaries": "The defendant, Chaquiro Blandino, appealed from a judgment of conviction after a jury found him guilty of (1) first-degree murder of Francis Rodriguez (2) discharging a firearm during a crime of violence (murder), resulting in the death of Rodriguez (3) assault with a dangerous weapon (a firearm) upon Marvin Vasquez (4) discharging a firearm during a crime of violence (assault with a dangerous weapon), without causing injury to Vasquez (5) discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle, creating a substantial risk of injury to Rodriguez and Vasquez and (6) unlawfully carrying a pistol without a license. The trial justice imposed consecutive life sentences on counts 1 and 2 a consecutive ten-year sentence on count 3 a consecutive ten-year sentence, non-parolable, on count 4 and concurrent ten-year sentences, suspended with probation, on counts 5 and 6, to run consecutive to count 4. On appeal, the defendant asserted that the trial justice erred when he denied the defendant's request to order the state to produce the investigative notes of the lead detective. The defendant argued before this Court that he was entitled to the notes pursuant to both Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) and Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The defendant also contended that the trial justice erred when he denied the defendant's motion for a new trial. The Supreme Court held that the defendant failed to articulate either a Brady or a Rule 16 argument when he sought production of the detective's notes therefore, those arguments were not preserved for appeal. Furthermore, the Court held that the trial justice committed no error in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial. Accordingly, the Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of conviction.",
