This file contains notes for upgrades when special instructions are necessary. In general, simply doing an

hg pull -u

is all that's necessary. In the case that special instructions are needed, we will attempt to put them here, with the
most recent at the top.

 - Adds a new method on the AbstractSite object that should be implemented by all calling libraries. This method is used
   to pass cookies from Juriscraper to the caller. Unfortunately, Texas makes this necessary in order to download the
   PDFs off their site. See the bottom of AbstractSite for details, and see sample_caller for how this might be used
   upstream.

2014-07-13:
 - Adds a new method on the AbstractSite object that should be implemented by all calling libraries. This method is used
   to do post-download cleanup on PDFs and HTML files that Juriscraper unearths. See the bottom of AbstractSite for
   details.

2014-07-10:
 - Adds the PhantomJS dependency officially. Looks like there's no crawling Texas without it.

2013-06-19:
 - The dependency on the requests library has been updated to version 1.2.3 in both CourtListener and Juriscraper:

    sudo pip uninstall requests
    sudo pip install requests==1.2.3
