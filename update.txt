This file contains notes for upgrades when special instructions are necessary.
In general, simply doing an

git pull

is all that's necessary. In the case that special instructions are needed, we
will attempt to put them here, with the most recent at the top.

2014-07-04:
 - Adds a new method on the AbstractSite object that should be implemented by
   all calling libraries. This method is used to pass cookies from Juriscraper
   to the caller. Unfortunately, Texas makes this necessary in order to
   download the PDFs off their site. See the bottom of AbstractSite for
   details, and see sample_caller for how this might be used upstream.

2014-07-13:
 - Adds a new method on the AbstractSite object that should be implemented by
   all calling libraries. This method is used to do post-download cleanup on
   PDFs and HTML files that Juriscraper unearths. See the bottom of
   AbstractSite for details.

2014-07-10:
 - Adds the PhantomJS dependency officially. Looks like there's no crawling
   Texas without it.

2013-06-19:
 - The dependency on the requests library has been updated to version 1.2.3 in
   both CourtListener and Juriscraper:

    sudo pip uninstall requests
    sudo pip install requests==1.2.3
