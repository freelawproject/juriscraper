    Kosobud v. Kosobud</a>,
2012 ND 122
<br>
Assets accumulated after separation but prior to divorce are included in the marital estate.<br>
The sporadic nature of the parties' marriage is a valid consideration for a court in making an equitable division of property.<br>
Marital property valuations are not clearly erroneous if they are within the range of evidence presented.<br>
When the exact dates of retirement and the resulting income reductions following retirement are unknown, a court may order permanent spousal support despite the obligor's approaching retirement.<br>

    Skachenko v. Skachenko</a>,
2012 ND 121
<br>
A district court does not abuse its discretion when it denies a party's motion to use frozen marital funds to conduct a business evaluation when the moving party has access to non-frozen, separate funds and has not addressed why the non-frozen,
separate funds cannot be used.<br>
A district court does not abuse its discretion when it denies a post-trial motion to include, as a separate asset of the marital estate, a loan owed by a party's business to the party when the loan was not included on the property and debt listing
filed with the court and was not at issue prior to or during trial.<br>
A district court has discretion to award attorney fees as a sanction for misconduct during litigation and must make findings regarding culpability of the party against whom sanctions are being imposed, prejudice against the moving party, and the
availability of less severe alternative sanctions.

    Dakota Resource Council v. Stark County Board of County Commissioners</a>,
2012 ND 114
<br>
A nonprofit organization that has not suffered an injury itself can sue as the representative of its members if: (1) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (2) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the
organization; and (3) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.<br>
Although interpretation of an ordinance presents a question of law fully reviewable on appeal, the interpretation of a zoning ordinance by a governmental entity is a quasi-judicial act, and a reviewing court should give deference to the judgment and
interpretation of the governing body rather than substitute its judgment for that of the enacting body.
<br><a href="/court/opinions/20120061.htm">
    Disciplinary Board v. Summers</a>,
2012 ND 116
<br>

A lawyer is permitted to disclose information related to the representation of a client when the lawyer is defending himself or herself in any proceeding concerning the lawyer's representation of the client, including disciplinary proceedings
initiated by a third party.<br>
A lawyer is required to comply with a hearing panel's order to disclose information related to the representation of a client during a disciplinary proceeding after the lawyer asserts all nonfrivolous claims to protect the confidential information.

The purpose of requiring the court's consent to dismissal under N.D.R.Crim.P. 48(a) is to prevent harassment of a defendant by charging, dismissing and recharging without placing a defendant in jeopardy.<br>
Rule 48(a) applies to the dismissal of a criminal charge and does not require the prosecuting attorney to take any specific action before a charge dismissed without prejudice can be refiled.
<br><a href="/court/opinions/20110350.htm">

    Working Capital #1 v. Quality Auto Body</a>,
2012 ND 115
<br>
An eviction to recover possession of real estate is maintainable when a lessee holds over after the termination of the lease or expiration of the lessee's term.<br>
N.D.C.C. 47-16-06 does not automatically renew a lease for up to one year when a tenant holds over and a landlord accepts a rent payment; rather, the section only raises a disputable presumption that the lease was renewed on the same terms.<br>
Issues or arguments not raised in the district court are generally not considered on appeal.
