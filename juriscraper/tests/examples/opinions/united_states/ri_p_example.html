Goldberg.&nbsp; On appeal, the Appellants contend that all three of the hearing justice’s holdings were made in error.<br><br>	The Supreme Court held that the section of the Financial Stability Act at issue did not entitle the Receiver to reimbursement of his attorneys’ fees because it did not specifically call for payment of attorneys’ fees as an exception to normal practice pursuant to “the American rule.”&nbsp; The Court then held that the Mayor was entitled to indemnification of his attorneys’ fees and costs because, in view of the unique set of factual circumstances presented in these cases, the Mayor was acting in his official capacity when he challenged the constitutionality of the Financial Stability Act and defended against the action for declaratory and injunctive relief that was filed by the Receiver.&nbsp; Lastly, the Court held that Attorney Goldberg, who represented the City Council, was entitled to his attorneys’ fees, since the City Council’s resolutions allowing for the hiring of outside counsel should have been recognized as being in full force and effect under the exceptional circumstances presented in these cases.&nbsp; Accordingly, the Court vacated the decision of the Superior Court in all respects and remanded the cases to that tribunal for a determination of the amount of attorneys’ fees still at issue.</div></td></tr><tr class="ms-alternating ms-newsletteralt"><td colspan="2"><img src="/_layouts/15/images/blank.gif?rev=23" width="100%" height="4" alt=""></td></tr><tr class=""><td class="ms-vb2">In re Jah-nell B., No. 14-38 (June 17, 2015)  </td><td class="ms-vb2"><a onfocus="OnLink(this)" href="/Courts/SupremeCourt/Opinions/14-38.pdf" onmousedown="return VerifyHref(this,event,'1','','')" onclick="return DispEx(this,event,'TRUE','FALSE','FALSE','','1','','','','','','1','0','0x1000031041','','')">14-38</a></td></tr><tr><td class="ms-vb-tall" colspan="2"><div dir="" class="ms-rtestate-field">The respondent, Clifton Barr, appealed from a decree entered in Family Court terminating his parental rights to his son, Jah-nell.&nbsp; The respondent contended that the trial justice erred in finding that he was unfit because clear and convincing evidence of his parental unfitness was absent from the record.&nbsp; The respondent also argued that the state failed to prove that the Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) made reasonable efforts to reunify him with his son prior to filing the petition to terminate his parental rights. <br><br>In reviewing this termination of parental rights, the Supreme Court examined the record to ascertain whether legal and competent evidence existed to support the findings of the trial justice.&nbsp; The trial justice found the respondent unfit pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 15-7-7(a)(1), (3), and (4).&nbsp; The trial justice also found that DCYF made reasonable efforts to reunify the respondent with his son.&nbsp; After careful review of the record, the Supreme Court was satisfied that legally competent evidence existed to support the trial justice’s findings.&nbsp; Accordingly, the Supreme Court affirmed the decree of the Family Court.&nbsp; <br></div></td></tr><tr class=""><td colspan="2"><img src="/_layouts/15/images/blank.gif?rev=23" width="100%" height="4" alt=""></td></tr><tr class="ms-alternating ms-newsletteralt"><td class="ms-vb2">Peerless Insurance Company v.

Carrera, 577 A.2d 980, 985 (R.I. 1990) applied not only to uninsured motorist insurance, but across all contexts of insurance.&nbsp; In Carrera, we gave the definition of resident: “In order to determine if a person is a resident of a particular household, the court must consider whether in the totality of the circumstances that person maintains a physical presence in the household with intent to remain for more than a mere transitory period * * * .”&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; Stated succinctly, the Supreme Court held that one who has a personal presence in a home, with intent to remain so for more than a temporary period, is considered a resident of that home.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Maya lived and slept at her father’s house twice a week, each week, in accordance with the couple’s custody agreement.&nbsp; Several of Maya’s personal belongings and items of clothing could be found in her father’s house.&nbsp; Family and friends visited Maya at her father’s house on these days.&nbsp; Importantly, the parents intended the arrangement to continue and it did indeed continue, even after the injuries sustained by Maya.&nbsp; The Supreme Court did not opine on Maya’s possible residency with her mother except to say that the fact that Maya may be a resident of her mother’s home does not make it impossible that she could also be a resident of her father’s home.&nbsp; Because Maya fit the definition of resident that the Supreme Court set forth in Carrera, a definition applicable across all insurance contexts, the summary judgment granted for the plaintiff, Peerless, was affirmed.<br></div></td></tr><tr class="ms-alternating ms-newsletteralt"><td colspan="2"><img src="/_layouts/15/images/blank.gif?rev=23" width="100%" height="4" alt=""></td></tr><tr class=""><td class="ms-vb2">Western Reserve Life Assurance Co. of Ohio v.

The water problems persisted over the next several years, culminating in March 2010, when the plaintiffs experienced extensive flooding of the property.&nbsp; As a result, the plaintiffs filed suit seeking to recover for alleged misrepresentations under the theories of breach of contract, negligence, and fraud.<br><br>	The defendants moved for summary judgment and argued that the negligence claims were barred by the statute of limitations, the fraud claim was barred by the disclaimer contained in the purchase and sales agreement, and that the contract claims failed as a matter of law.&nbsp; After multiple hearings before two separate justices of the Superior Court, the defendants’ motions were granted.&nbsp; On appeal, the plaintiffs argued that the defendants waived their statute of limitations defense because they failed to raise it in their answer, or, in the alternative, that they were entitled to have the limitations period tolled.&nbsp; Also, the plaintiffs argued that genuine issues of material fact precluded judgment from entering on the fraud claim.<br><br>	The Supreme Court held that the hearing justice properly dismissed the plaintiffs’ negligence claims based on the statute of limitations.&nbsp; The Supreme Court explained that the defendants did not waive their statute of limitations defense because it was raised well in advance of trial, and that the plaintiffs were not entitled to have the limitations period tolled because after numerous water problems that occurred shortly after the purchase, they knew, or should have known in the exercise of reasonable diligence, that they were injured.<br><br>	Next, the Supreme Court held that the hearing justice erroneously dismissed the plaintiffs’ fraud claim based on the disclaimer contained in the purchase and sales agreement because it was not drawn with sufficient specificity.&nbsp; The Court also rejected the defendants’ arguments that, notwithstanding the absence of an effective disclaimer, the fraud claim failed because genuine issues of fact existed with respect to the defendants’ knowledge, or lack thereof, about the water problems.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>	Finally, the Supreme Court held that summary judgment was properly granted as to the claim of breach of the implied warranty of good faith and fair dealing in light of the plaintiffs’ voluntary dismissal of their breach of contract claim.<br><br>	Accordingly, the Supreme Court affirmed the pretrial grants of summary judgment on the plaintiffs’ negligence and contract claims, but vacated the grant of summary judgment on the fraud claim.</div></td></tr><tr class=""><td colspan="2"><img src="/_layouts/15/images/blank.gif?rev=23" width="100%" height="4" alt=""></td></tr><tr class="ms-alternating ms-newsletteralt"><td class="ms-vb2">Rhode Island Joint Reinsurance Association v.

Cruz responded by filing an action in the Superior Court seeking a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, an order quieting title, and compensatory damages.&nbsp; The complaint also sought a declaration that the assignment from MERS to ACT Properties was invalid because the signer was unauthorized.<br>	<br>Before this Court, MERS contended that the hearing justice should have granted its motion for a protective order because Cruz had no standing to challenge the validity of an assignment to which she was neither a party nor a third-party beneficiary.&nbsp; MERS argued that any contention that the signer lacked the requisite authority would render the assignments, at most, voidable, instead of void.<br><br>	Adopting the holding of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Wilson v. HSBC Mortgage Services, Inc., 744 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2014), the Supreme Court limited standing to those instances where a homeowner challenges a mortgage assignment as void.&nbsp; The Court reasoned that a corporate officer acting outside the scope of his or her authority creates a voidable contract that can still be ratified by the corporation.&nbsp; As a result, the Court held that, even if successful, Cruz’s challenge to the signer’s authority would merely render the assignment voidable at the election of one of the parties to the assignment.&nbsp; Because Cruz was not a party to the assignment, she lacked standing to challenge it, and her attempts to engage in corresponding discovery were barred.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>	Having concluded that Cruz lacked standing to challenge the signer’s authority, the Court found that the hearing justice erred in denying the motion for a protective order.&nbsp; As such, the hearing justice’s denial of the motion for a protective order was quashed.<br></div></td></tr><tr class=""><td colspan="2"><img src="/_layouts/15/images/blank.gif?rev=23" width="100%" height="4" alt=""></td></tr><tr class="ms-alternating ms-newsletteralt"><td class="ms-vb2">Virginia B.

Callery, a medical examiner who had worked on the infant’s autopsy file while employed on a contract basis with Rhode Island’s Office of State Medical Examiners (OSME).&nbsp; Doctor Callery’s testified before the original trial justice at a three-day hearing for postconviction relief in July of 2011.&nbsp; Doctor Callery testified that his role at OSME was to review and complete the autopsy files that had been begun and left unfinished by Dr. Samuel A. Livingstone, a medical examiner who no longer worked in the office.&nbsp; Doctor Callery testified that, when he viewed the D’Alessio file, he was unable to agree with the preliminary conclusion that the infant’s manner of death was homicide by a violent shaking.&nbsp; Doctor Callery testified that this was due to the poor condition of the file, including its slides and photographs.&nbsp; However, Dr. Callery was not able to provide a definite conclusion as to the manner of death, nor did he dispute that the file could have been completed in order to confirm the conclusion that the manner of death was a homicide.&nbsp; In ruling on the application, the hearing justice noted that Dr. Laposata’s trial testimony was definite in her conclusions, backed by her medical experience, and based on a complete file.&nbsp; Because Dr. Callery’s testimony was not of the type that would ultimately change the verdict at a new trial, the hearing justice denied the application for postconviction relief. <br><br>On appeal, the applicant advanced three arguments.&nbsp; First, applicant contended the hearing justice was clearly erroneous when he ruled that the newly discovered evidence was not material and would not change the verdict at trial.&nbsp; Second, he alleged the court erred by raising and denying, sua sponte, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.&nbsp; Third, applicant argued that his right to due process was violated when the state withheld evidence from the defense in violation of the applicant’s constitutional rights as set forth in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The Supreme Court concluded that the first argument was without merit and that the second and third arguments were not properly before this Court because they were not raised in the postconviction-relief hearing below.&nbsp; Doctor Callery’s testimony was simply not strong enough to warrant relief and instead was of such a vague and indefinite nature that it could not create a “reasonable probability of a different result.”&nbsp; Doctor Callery said he did not remember specifically what the file contained, failed to offer a definite conclusion, and ultimately did not provide evidence that meets this Court’s test for materiality.&nbsp; If Dr. Callery’s testimony were to be offered at trial alongside the testimony of Dr. Laposata, it was not of a type that would likely change the verdict at a new trial.&nbsp; The Court found no clear error in the hearing justice’s ruling. <br><br>Accordingly, the Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court’s denial of postconviction relief.</div></td></tr><tr class="ms-alternating ms-newsletteralt"><td colspan="2"><img src="/_layouts/15/images/blank.gif?rev=23" width="100%" height="4" alt=""></td></tr><tr class=""><td class="ms-vb2">Wayne DeMarco et al. v.

Malinou, had owned the property and had executed a “reverse mortgage” thereon.&nbsp; After Mrs. Malinou’s death, the defendant inherited the property and payment of the note executed by Mrs. Malinou was demanded in full.&nbsp; No payments were made.&nbsp; As a result, the property was sold at a foreclosure sale.&nbsp; Thereafter, the property was conveyed to the plaintiff, which filed a trespass and ejectment action in the District Court.&nbsp; The case was transferred to the Superior Court for trial where judgment entered in favor of the plaintiff. <br><br>On appeal, the defendant raised five arguments: (1) The Superior Court did not have personal or subject matter jurisdiction over the controversy because there was no service on the estate; (2) deference should not be given to the trial justice’s findings of fact because they were based on documentary evidence; (3) the trial justice erred when she required clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption in favor of Fannie Mae; (4) the trial justice erred when she failed to enforce the subpoenas duces tecum issued upon Lender Processing Services, Inc. and Bank of America; and (5) an August 2012 tax-sale deed in favor of Rookies Real Estate divested Fannie Mae of the right to possess the property. <br><br>The Supreme Court held that the personal jurisdiction argument was waived because it was not raised in the Superior Court.&nbsp; The Supreme Court also concluded that the trial court was vested with subject matter jurisdiction because the defendant answered the complaint and appeared in court.&nbsp; With respect to the defendant’s second argument, the Supreme Court held that it was well established that deference be given to the trial justice’s decision when sitting without a jury.&nbsp; Next, the Supreme Court upheld the trial justice’s finding that the defendant failed to rebut the presumption that Fannie Mae was entitled to possession of the property.&nbsp; Further, the Supreme Court held that the trial justice’s decision to not enforce the subpoenas that were overbroad and issued on the eve of trial was not an abuse of discretion.&nbsp; Finally, the Supreme Court held that the defendant’s argument concerning the tax-sale deed was meritless because the plaintiff was within the redemption period. <br><br>Accordingly, the Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court.&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></td></tr><tr class=""><td colspan="2"><img src="/_layouts/15/images/blank.gif?rev=23" width="100%" height="4" alt=""></td></tr><tr class="ms-alternating ms-newsletteralt"><td class="ms-vb2">Desmond A.

Leone, appealed a Superior Court entry of summary judgment against him and in favor of the defendants Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems (MERS), Equity One, Inc. (Equity One), and Assets Recovery Center Investments, LLC (ARC).&nbsp; The plaintiff had executed a mortgage, using his Johnston home as collateral, with Equity One as the lender and MERS as the named mortgagee.&nbsp; MERS later assigned its interest in the mortgage to ARC.&nbsp; Upon entering default for failure to make timely payments, ARC began foreclosure proceedings and the home was sold in November of 2009.&nbsp; The plaintiff filed an action for declaratory relief in Providence County Superior Court seeking declarations that the assignment of his mortgage from MERS to ARC was invalid and to quiet title to the property. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The defendants filed a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure and the hearing justice converted the motion to one for summary judgment when he considered materials provided to him by the parties that were outside of the pleadings.&nbsp; In granting summary judgment for the defendants, the hearing justice declared that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <br><br>On appeal, the plaintiff advanced a number of arguments.&nbsp; First, the plaintiff contested the hearing justice’s conversion of the motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment.&nbsp; Next, the plaintiff contended that summary judgment was incorrectly granted to the defendants because there were genuine issues of material fact.&nbsp; The plaintiff argued that the assignment of the mortgage from MERS to ARC was invalid, that the foreclosure by ARC was improper, and that the hearing justice improperly relied on other Superior Court decisions. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The Supreme Court concluded that these arguments were without merit.&nbsp; Rule 12(b) says that if a hearing justice considers materials outside the pleadings the motion shall be converted to one for summary judgment.&nbsp; Here, both the plaintiff and the defendants submitted extraneous documents and should have been on notice of the motion’s conversion.&nbsp; On the remaining points, the Supreme Court found on facts similar to those in Bucci v. Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB, 68 A.3d 1069, 1085 (R.I. 2013), MERS was the mortgagee with the Statutory Power of Sale and not simply the nominee of the lender.&nbsp; The assignment of the mortgage from MERS to ARC was valid and consistent with the Court’s decision in Mruk v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., 82 A.3d 527 (R.I. 2013).&nbsp; Further, the limited power of attorney from Equity One to ARC gave ARC the rights of the lender in addition to the rights of mortgagee.&nbsp; Therefore, the foreclosure by ARC on the property was proper.&nbsp; These were questions of law properly settled by the hearing justice. <br><br>Accordingly, the Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court’s grant of summary judgment. </div></td></tr><tr class="ms-alternating ms-newsletteralt"><td colspan="2"><img src="/_layouts/15/images/blank.gif?rev=23" width="100%" height="4" alt=""></td></tr><tr class=""><td class="ms-vb2">Kevin R.
